One day in December 2019 I decided to watch an episode of Lupin IIIrd, because, why not? I had heard the name and knew nothing about it, only that it was a "classic" anime and I was feeling nostalgic for the rare anime that showed up on Cartoon Network as a kid. 2 and a half years later, I've watched...well, every single piece of published Lupin IIIrd content I can find. It's been a lot of content, but I don't regret more than a few hours of it. üòÅ If I'm missing something, let me know (I'm waiting for the Part VI blurays, rather than trying to stream it).

To help set the stage for the ratings below, I'm big on hijinks and not so hot on the violence. For the columns, I've given a ‚úÖ if something was particularly good, ‚ùå if it was particularly bad, and nothing if it was neutral/uninteresting. In the "Other" column, I've added occasional additional ratings: the opening (usually what occurs before the title screen), the ending (usually the last third), fanservice (references to other Lupin movies or otherwise), and violence (generally blood or too much fighting).

The overall ratings are as below. 0.5s are mostly meant to help provide a bit more order to the ratings. In most cases, there will be something that almost made it better, but not quite. Within ratings, the individual groups are unordered, rather, they are ordered by release date ‚Äì oldest first.

* 5 - Fantastic, recommend to everyone
* 4 - Very good, with some moments less than stellar
* 3 - Fine, would watch again with others, but would not seek out
* 2 - Meh, mostly mediocre, would probably not watch again
* 1 - Bad, actively bad, would encourage people to not watch
* 0 - There is no reason to watch this and I almost regret the time spent watching it

                <td>Rasputin really made this cringe - too many sticking of fingers in mouths? Like wtf? There really
                    wasn't anything compelling about the NPC, art, or characterizations that made up for it and as the
                    movie went on, kept getting worse. Plus, the subtitles called zantetsuken 'steel cleaver'? or
                    something like that. Goemon basically didn't show up, so it was a moot point. Some funny, bawdy
                    jokes, at least?

                    was the best, but was literally laid up for most of it.

                    was awful (as was his characterization), plot was both dumb and weird?, NPC was solidly meh,
                    unnecessary subplot about Jigen being a homophone?, antagonist unbearable. Literally the only
                    redeeming part was Zenigata, but he was in it for maybe 3 minutes total.

                    owner of the sapphire), good Zenigata and Jigen, too. The Conan characters annoy me a lot. Took a
                    ton of tries to finish and was quite confusing ‚Äì maybe the OVA was supposed to be watched first?
                    Either way, not really coherent. Also, the version I watched had some sub issues sometimes, which
                    didn't help.
