#This. Is. WUHAAAAAN.
<tag>travel</tag> <tag>china</tag> \\ 2009-06-26

We’re not actually there yet, but we’re leaving tonight by way of train. Wuhan is located in the east-middle part of China at the convergence of some rivers. The weather varies between 77-97 degrees and they don’t eat a lot of meat.

Yesterday we ate a super fancy restaurant that Bush and Clinton ate at with Donna and Mrs. Yin’s very well-to-do friend. HAH! I beat Barack!

Not a whole lot has gone on, but we figured that if we update now, this gets us out of updating again for awhile in Wuhan, since we won’t have access to Internet outside of dingy webcafes. (uploading here is very slow...hopefully a lot of pictures next time - I'm at 700 or so right now)
