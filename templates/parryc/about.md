I have an undying love for language: everything from computational linguistics to Mandarin Chinese to typography. 

I am an avid traveler and love to play badminton.

I am a [budding beer](http://record.beer) drinker and a journeyman mixologist. 

I like puns, video games, and pretty things. 

I like steampunk, biopunk, and cyberpunk, but not really British punk. 

I can spin various objects on my pointer finger. 

I collect records. 

I swear by LaTeX. 

And I have a surprising number of dictionaries to and from languages I can't read.
