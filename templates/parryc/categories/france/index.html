	    	<p>Marseille: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Ignore the Urine.</p>

<p>Ok - so our last day in Marseille was not…horrible. Marseille still gave us the finger by saying it was too windy to visit Chateau d’If, so we went to Frioul Islands instead, which while not as Antonio Banderas as the other island, was a lot more “picturesque Mediterranean island.” That’s something I’m ok with - well barring my fear of water that can hold sharks (this includes everything from seas, to pools, to Lake Minnetonka). We spent the remainder of Marseille wandering around and avoiding roving gangs of underground hip-hop artists - also known as “those assholes who keep me up with their so-called ‘music.’”</p>

<p>With a nice, pretty day and nice wandering we had thought that Marseille was going to be nice to us and let us leave in peace. But no, karma is a bitch. Or rather, Marseille is a bitch. And a tricky one at that, a Richard Nixon if you will. Marseille let us leave just fine, but an hour outside of Marseille, in Nice (which apparently is not nice) <em>THE TRAIN TRACKS CAUGHT FIRE</em>. How does that happen? Who lets that happen? <strong>HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT?</strong> Needless to say we were delayed in the Nice train station for seven hours. Seriously, how long does it take to put out a fire? It either started as we were pulling in or sometime before. Marseille, we understand we hurt your feelings, but come on, maybe if you cleaned up a little, shaved, got a hair cut, some nice shoes, y’know, then maybe we could be seen in public together. Just let us get to our next destination, please.</p>

<p>But yes, the fact of the matter is that Marseile smells like an alcoholic homeless man who peed himself. It doesn’t help that Marseille is home to a large amount of homeless men who’ve peed themselves. Get off the train - urine. Walk to the harbor - fish…and urine. Walk to the Arc de Triomphe - urine! Yay! Also, dog crap everywhere. Adding insult to injury.</p>

	    	<p>I have found my greener pastures. Those pastures where no matter which side you look at your side is always greener and theirs always a little bit brown. I’m talking about Strasbourg. Strasbourg is a city of many things: beautiful buildings, beautiful scenery, beautiful food, beautiful beauty. It’s very nice - the weather is great and the atmosphere very relaxing. There’s only about 400,000 people all told (compare this to the 1.3M people in Minneapolis and the metro area), it’s a very…quaint place. Not quaint in the bad sense, but in the “I can’t believe there’s a city that’s actually like this.” It’s very reminiscent of old school Germany. This is like straight up old school. Not like…70 years ago old school.</p>

	    	<p>First, I’d like to apologize to my sole reader, Chinese netizen XOXChailmanMeowXOX, who uses this blog to practice his English, for not updating lately. Y’know how riding first class across central asia and taking a train all over Paris makes your scatter-brained and forgetful.</p>
