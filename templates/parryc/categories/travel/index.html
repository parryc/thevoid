	    	<p>I have once again had the wonderful privilege of visiting Almaty, Kazakhstan for the fourth time.  This time around, I have learned that if I am a certain combination of crazy, wealthy, and presidential, I can actually change that number arbitrarily and everyone will agree. Kazakhs have a great ability to change other’s perception of history. For example, their radio stations. If you’ve listened to their oldies station you would be convinced that not only did they invent electronica, they used it exclusively to remix Abba songs. 
<br /><br />
<em>If I change your mind, I’m the first in line.  Baby I’m not free, independence for me.</em></p>

<p>But this is not actually too surprising, because the Kazakh people have actually created history as we know it.  You don’t believe me? Below I have translated the abridged version of <strong>The History of the Kazakh People According to the Crazy Guy on the Train Who Was Pretty Sure I Was From Virginia or Nevada</strong></p>

	    	<p>In the spirit of the Olympics, I have attempted to set a new record for “Longest Time Without Writing a Blog Post” – naw, just kidding. I’m just lazy. However, I have been using this time to “observe” (but don’t tell my boss, I’ve been telling him I’ve been programming).</p>

<p>As a commuter I spend a lot of time on the subway. I’ve mastered its tricks, its trades, and its stock exchange. I can do the Sleep-Until-Your-Stop, the No-Holds-Stand, the Doze-Off-Standing, and the Read-A-Book-In-Someone-Else’s-Hands. If there was a way to monetize these skills, I’d be rollin’ in the dough. (and subsequently wouldn’t have to ride the subway – you can see where I’m going with this.)</p>

<p>Independent of marketable skills, the Shanghai Metro has brought out my muse better than any Beatrice ever has. What I present to you below is my first work from what is likely to be part of my opus (in stores and Amazon soon!) comprised solely of unconnected ramblings written while sitting.</p>

	    	<p>I’m ashamed to admit that I have a problem. Well, I’m probably ashamed. I’m pretty sure shame is outlawed in China - and you know how good I am at avoiding breaking laws (hence why I no longer mail anything).</p>

<p>What is this problem?</p>

<p>I don’t know what the food I eat at restaurants looks like raw. I order something delicious, say “8 Splced Hevenly Chriken.” Chicken. I like chicken. I can say chicken and I can say meat. Hell, I even know what a chicken looks like in real life. Buying chicken at the super market should be easy as pie!</p>

<p>So I walk to butcher’s area of the supermarket and look at what they have to offer. Various organs (I think), various limbs (I think), various… things that I’m not entirely sure are meat, but are there anyways. Some pre-cut meat things that have pig stickers on them. I’m pretty sure that these are pork. But it’s China and the labels don’t actually say pork anywhere on them…so, maybe only 80% sure.</p>

	    	<p>This is going to be my last blog post in Harbin - and I figure I should write it now before I…study…this weekend. Finals are coming up and given that there is only one full weekend left together with all of these new friends, the sensible thing to do is study. You’ll know where to find me. In my “room.”</p>

<p>Ok, I lie. I may not be in my room. I might be in the Harbin Institute of Technology Science Park. For those of you don’t know what a Science Park, it’s like an Arboretum of Science. If you don’t know what an arboretum is, imagine model rockets and used boosters growing haphazardly out of the ground. Now why might I be there (besides the concept itself being awesome)? There are three reasons: I’ve started jogging, I love lilacs, and retired Chinese people are awesome.</p>

	    	<p>Every semester CET plans a rip-roaring adventure to some city other than Harbin, most likely in order to convince students that not all of China is cold.  The way they go about accomplishing this goal is actually quite clever: by going south. 12 hours south via train, to be precise.  Now you may be thinking “the title says land of opportunity, I was unaware NAME-OF-YOUR-COUNTRY (to appeal to a wider audience) was south of China.”  And you would be right, unless you’re from North Korea.  But you’re not. (If you are, please comment otherwise).</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, CET Spring Semester 2012 “Road” Trip was to Dandong, a large Chinese city on the North Korean border.  Now, clearly none of the activities involved crossing the border (unfortunately), but a lot of them involved looking at North Korea, which is surprisingly fun.  For instance, we got to look at North Koreans farm while we stood on a portion of the Great Wall.  We were literally a stone’s throw away. (If me throwing a stone into N. Korean broke any international laws, then I was figuratively a stone’s throw away). I now have the entire life of a North Korean cow documented. It mostly involves eating and drinking.</p>

	    	<p>There are sandstorms in Harbin. Which means that you should probably keep any and all eating utensils by an open window. I can guarantee that they will stay clean. At least most of the time, which you know, is really all that matters. I mean, when you think of it, you’re not even eating most of the time.</p>

<p>But this aside, I got back from a “whirlwind” “adventure” in “Zhejiang provence.” I say “whirlwind” because there weren’t any whirlwinds, “adventure” because I already knew where everything was, and “Zhejiang provence” cause I thought adding quotes made it looked “better.” On my escape from the salty North (seriously, pretty sure I saw a road-side stall that was selling potatoes, salt, and pineapples - you don’t need much else to make a traditional “Dongbei” dish), I got a chance to visit some old friends, make some new ones, and eat a lot of tasty food. But the most important thing is just that: “things.”</p>

	    	<p>Occasionally Chinese people will say “Oh My Lady Gaga!” as opposed to things like “Oh My!” Your guess is as good as mine.</p>

<p>Anywho, I have learned through in depth study that American study techniques and Chinese study techniques are wildly different. Most Chinese students (engineering students in particular) will go to the library, work for hours on end and have most, if not all of the material memorized, ready to ace the test. American students (sample size: me) will buy a lot of snack food, spend too much time trying to decide if Ritz crackers filled with yogurt are the best things or the worst things (they’re the best), and then take a four hour nap in the middle of the day.</p>

	    	<p>Walking around the streets and entering the shops of a foreign city is probably the best way to get acquainted with a new city. That and Wikipedia. But seriously, it’s great, you get to see all sorts of things that aren’t distilled and purified for easy consumption in language class. It also gives you a bunch of chances to make a dammed fool of oneself.</p>

<p>For example, purchasing things. I’d like to think that I have “mastered” the ability to read signs and purchase associated products. Apparently not in Chinese. One day I noticed that a store was having a sale on Kleenexes - perfect, I was running low. I go in, look at the sign, read the brand name and as I’m reading the rest of the sign reach out to grab a package of something that matches the part of the sign I’ve read so far. I look down and see a female employee giving me the strangest look. I look down and quickly drop the package of female sanitary pads I had just been holding so contemplatively. I then proceed to get lost in the same store for another 15 minutes and repeatedly pass the same employee who continues to stare at me with a strange mix of accusation and incredulity.</p>

<p>If you’re one of the many who don’t come from a miniature version of Siberia, I should probably clarify: for those who have never been to Harbin and plan on visiting during some time other than the two weeks they call summer, it’s not actually that cold. If anything, global warming has been good to Harbin. It’s significantly warmer this winter than it was last winter. I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to find the actual temperature (so as not to unduly scare people away).</p>

<p>My time in Londontown has come to an end and the last few days have passed in a blur (or…haze, depending). There have been crazy hobos, bent on stealing one’s kidneys, and there have been crazy undergrads, bent on stealing delicious muffins from string theory conferences. This trip has opened my eyes to many new things (e.g. that Jimothy really likes Smirnoff Ice) and closed them to many others (e.g. I will never, ever, have a good British accent).</p>

<p>To wrap up, I present to you the last bit of pictures from the trip. This opting out of writing more is definitely not because most of the last few days were trying to get Jimothy to drink more. That would have been a horrible thing for a group of friends to do. It was spent at museums (3 hour complete traversal of the British Museum? Probably a record…for better or worse). And uh… looking at statues. (Or, in one particularly great moment, when getting Jimothy to pose in front of a statue, an entire bus of Asian tourists pulled up in front of us and all started taking pictures of him).</p>

Other people return and are pretty sure they had a 10 day long fever dream. Some people go to Kazakhstan and it’s a slightly disorienting mixture of the two. And then some people go to Kazakhstan and hang out with Ilyas and all bets are off.</p>

<p>Let me begin by clarifying the title. I am not the Shymkentskii who is returning. It’s an actual guy from Shymkent who has returned to Almaty and is undoubtably causing mayhem by simply existing. Ilyas and I, however, value our lives and intellect and thus have avoided this guy, who, for the sake of discussion, I’ll start calling him Jim. Jim isn’t a Kazakh name, but then again, Shymkent probably, for the sake of Kazakhstan’s national image, shouldn’t be considered Kazakh. You might expect me to insert some sort of disclaimer saying “Sorry to any and all Shymkentskiis reading this,” but people from Shymkent are the kind of people who if you hooked a typewriter up to a TV you could convince them they were playing a video game.</p>

	    	<p>Some of you may be thinking “Wow, Parry must be having a really awesome time, as he hasn’t updated his blog in DAYS.” For those of you who I am actively trying to impress, yes, my times are all awesome. For those of you who realize that most of what I do is mundane - I’ve been at work. For those of you who stumbled upon this by accident, go with the first one: I’m awesome.</p>

<p>Anywho, as much as I’ve tried to make programming as adventuresome as possible, there’s only so many ways to make it so. Most of those ways are obscure and hard to find and I have unfortunately haven’t found any of them. I think instead I’m going to go into archaeology - I’m not afraid of snakes and I’ve been told I look quite rugged, or at least like a rug, which has to count for something.</p>

<p>One thing that has made the days a little different is the fact that most of the company (and by most, I mean all. Because there are only 4 people other than the interns.) is involved in Ultimate frisbee. Last weekend was the Shanghai Invitational Ultimate tournament, of which I was the TD. What’s a TD you ask? My first guess was that I was a touchdown, a man who just by existing scored 6 points for my home team. Considering most of what I did consisted of running around with a megaphone and airhorn and trying to explain the concept of a waiver in Chinese, I don’t think my position was point based. I will assume that it means that I was the Tournament Director. Which is kind of cool.</p>

	    	<p>So some of you (Hi mom!) might be wondering why I haven’t updated in a week. I mean, I’m in a major city of a world power, there has to be Internet, right? This is where you would be sadly mistaken. The Internet, like nice hair, is something reserved for a select few in China, namely those who know the vocabulary for “that one thing you plug into your computer to get Internet.” Also, you need to fight a bear - they’ve become quite a problem for the Chinese.</p>

<p>After fighting said bear and having Annie just go ahead and buy said Internet-thing, I am now up and running, without the actual running - sedentary is (one of) my middle name(s). However, that’s not to say I don’t get sufficient exercise. There’s the 10 minute walk to the subway station, the 40 minutes of sweating along with all the other commuters and then another 10 minute walk to the office, where I sit and slow roast for 8 hours. If anyone has ever tells you that Shanghai is temperate (or any other word that indicates less than 100% humidity), slap them in the face. Even if you haven’t been here to confirm that, do it anyways. For me.</p>

<p>Ok, ok, so it’s not that bad, but it will be, I’m just trying to get you to commiserate with me early.</p>

	    	<p>Hello reader of my blog! Yes you! It’s that time of the year again: Parry goes traveling! However, as this was over winter break, it was only Amsterdam for one day and then Almaty for a week. (Hmm. AA. I wonder if that’s indicative of anything……no, of course not.)</p>

<p>As Amsterdam was more of a layover consisting of me walking in circles for 6 hours and then passing out on my hotel bed at 8pm from jet lag, we’ll skip that.</p>

<p>Kazakhstan though, Kazakhstan is the place to be. Let me start by explaining my title. What is a mambyet? Imagine a state, let’s call it New Jersey. Now imagine that that state is filled with people who exist only to destroy any hope that intelligence is default in the human species. Did your thoughts stray to Iowa? If so, that’s ok, Jersey and Iowa are both acceptable examples of this behavior. You may still be a little confused, am I right? A mambyet, for example might where sunglasses at night, not so he can, so he can keep track of visions in his eyes, but because he was unaware that sunglasses are used while the sun is up. People have moonglasses for a reason. They also look vaguely like their parents beat them with frying pans for not taking the trash out.</p>

<p>You have been warned.</p>

	    	<p>Marseille: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Ignore the Urine.</p>

<p>Ok - so our last day in Marseille was not…horrible. Marseille still gave us the finger by saying it was too windy to visit Chateau d’If, so we went to Frioul Islands instead, which while not as Antonio Banderas as the other island, was a lot more “picturesque Mediterranean island.” That’s something I’m ok with - well barring my fear of water that can hold sharks (this includes everything from seas, to pools, to Lake Minnetonka). We spent the remainder of Marseille wandering around and avoiding roving gangs of underground hip-hop artists - also known as “those assholes who keep me up with their so-called ‘music.’”</p>

<p>With a nice, pretty day and nice wandering we had thought that Marseille was going to be nice to us and let us leave in peace. But no, karma is a bitch. Or rather, Marseille is a bitch. And a tricky one at that, a Richard Nixon if you will. Marseille let us leave just fine, but an hour outside of Marseille, in Nice (which apparently is not nice) <em>THE TRAIN TRACKS CAUGHT FIRE</em>. How does that happen? Who lets that happen? <strong>HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT?</strong> Needless to say we were delayed in the Nice train station for seven hours. Seriously, how long does it take to put out a fire? It either started as we were pulling in or sometime before. Marseille, we understand we hurt your feelings, but come on, maybe if you cleaned up a little, shaved, got a hair cut, some nice shoes, y’know, then maybe we could be seen in public together. Just let us get to our next destination, please.</p>

	    	<p>I have found my greener pastures. Those pastures where no matter which side you look at your side is always greener and theirs always a little bit brown. I’m talking about Strasbourg. Strasbourg is a city of many things: beautiful buildings, beautiful scenery, beautiful food, beautiful beauty. It’s very nice - the weather is great and the atmosphere very relaxing. There’s only about 400,000 people all told (compare this to the 1.3M people in Minneapolis and the metro area), it’s a very…quaint place. Not quaint in the bad sense, but in the “I can’t believe there’s a city that’s actually like this.” It’s very reminiscent of old school Germany. This is like straight up old school. Not like…70 years ago old school.</p>

Knowing this, away from home and away from drinking age limits, my drink of choice is milk tea. Although, apparently horse milk is mildly intoxicating - so who knows, tea could become the next college cheap intoxicant…</p>

<p>But anyways, knowing that I’ve been drinking mostly tea for the last few weeks, my body is not ready for alcohol. Which makes the Kazakh custom of providing alcohol to and toasting to the guest a…physically trying custom. Cue Mr. Kuzembayev the Grandpa.</p>

<p>“Would you like vodka, whiskey, or Kazakh cognac?”</p>

<p>Not being one to pass up an opportunity to trying new things (read: not being allowed to pass up opportunities to try new things), I opted for the Kazakh cognac. As soon as I saw Ilyas say no, I knew I shouldn’t have accepted.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, Kazakhstan is an awesome place. Located within spitting distance of the Tian Shan Mountains, the scenery and nature in this place is quite extraordinary. While still hot, maybe 80-90 degrees, it’s not nearly as humid as Shanghai. This means that your clothing will actually dry. I like this about a city. I’ve spent the last few days hiking around the mountains surrounding Almaty and hanging out with Ilyas, Nuraziz, and their friends. There was one night where we were out quite late and decided to just go chill on a mountain and watch the sunrise. When I mean mountain, I really mean mountain, we were 2500m above sea level? We were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimbulak">here</a>.</p>

	    	<p>In a turn of events that I can only describe as “delicious,” I am now in Holland. I have found the Netherlands to be a mysterious land, filled with fat white 40 year old women, biracial couples, Surinam, and too many tattoos.</p>

<p>Arriving in the Netherlands has been quite the culture shock. This was not helped by the fact that the first street I walk down happened to be the heart of the “red light district.” I have never seen so many naked people, nor smelled so much pot, nor seen so many over priced Chinese restaurants in one place. But I guess other than the stereotypical coffeeshops and what not, Amsterdam is pretty chill. However, for someone who was used to the different culture each street Shanghai had to offer (seriously, still confused by “California-esque stucco” on Fuxing Lu - How did that happen?), wandering around Amsterdam for 5 hours was a little bit meh. It was not helped by me getting lost in a thunderstorm, getting splashed by a car going through a puddle, still being lost, and then finally getting back to the hotel. That’s not to say I don’t like Amsterdam, it’s just it’s quite a bit different than my month in Shanghai. For example, in terms of “count rare things,” it’s usually “count the black people” (The answer is 31), however, here it’s “count the number of Indian+other-race couples (the answer is 0).</p>

	    	<p>Harkening back to a grand tradition that has been plaguing mankind since the building large areas with buildings to visit became popular, the day you decide to go to visit these buildings it’s 95 degrees and so humid you could swim. This is interesting, because in theory it will be 95 degrees and humid all the time… Hm.</p>

<p>I never thought it could get so damnedably hot out. Ok, I lie. How can you forget last year’s “Happy Birthday Parry, it’s 104 out and we don’t have airconditioning!”</p>

<p>But being so downright awful for human habitation means that only 100,000 people were there with me! The first step to getting into the World Expo was to be hearded into holding pens to await going through security. This is where the true human comes out.

	    	<p>I spent the last 5 days in Tongxiang 桐乡 visiting my friend, Millie, from my trip to China 2 years. Tongxiang is only 62 km away from Shanghai, so in theory a bus would take around an hour (if one considers highway speeds here are 60-100kmh). However going anywhere dubbed “Shanghai” is like wading through molasses wearing lead weights on the Sun.</p>

<p>Anyways after who knows how long I actually made it there. Millie lives with her boyfriend and his parents in a very swank 2 floor apartment. The housing market in Tongxiang, while still exorbitantly priced is apparently affordable on a government official and school owner’s salary. Yeah, Millie’s not just a teacher, she actually owns the school she works at. Due to the dismal state of the Chinese education system (pupils hate their teachers and vice-versa), apparently most of the useful learning is done in private after-school schools. Jack, the boyfriend, is a government official who I think works on mangaging security for things. As an official, the government gives him money specifically to buy a house - hence the reason why it seems like government officials in China own 3 houses. They have nothing to do with that money but to buy houses.</p>

	    	<p>The Nationalist treason and plot.  I know of no reason, why the Communist win Should ever be forgot. On many military emblems throughout China has 八二 (8/2), signifying the Communist “Independence Day.”</p>

<p>Much of CCTV was filled with praise and glory and really bad Communist music for the defeat of the Nationalists 60 years ago.</p>

<p> Our last week was just as epic as the Communist celebration. We ate 狗肉, which I thought was fine, but it isn’t something I’d go out of my way to get. To be honest, in the range of “less commonly eaten animals,” donkey is a lot more delicious. Our culinary deliciousness does not compare to what we did for 3 days…</p>

	    	<p>Jilin is a city of many things: water, people drinking beer next to the water, 80 degree weather, and Packer fans (this one may or may not be true). With this in mind, imagine the level of activity and busyness that we’re experiencing. None. At all. The standard schedule is a combination of eating meals, playing DS, or in Kevin and my case, studying Chinese. The routine has, however, been broken up occasionally.</p>

	    	<p>We have recently arrived in Beijing, home of really really warm weather and deserted Olympic stadiums. The day was spent wandering around the Olympic village and wandering through the Bird Nest and Water Cube. To give you a good idea of what these are imagine yourself at the Metrodome and make the white grey and you have the Bird’s Nest. Imagine 4 pools in a cube, the Water Cube. We’ll be in Bejing for 5 days, but the Forbidden City and the Great Wall are tentative.</p>

	    	<p>Our first city is Bao An, located in the middle of nowhere. According to Mr. Yin, the only way to find it on a satellite map is if you knew where it was already and then looked for a giant lake thing…and then you’d be close. Bao An is a farmer’s town. It is surrounded by farms…which never seem to have anyone in them, and dirt and dense rainforest like jungles. The city itself is in the process of a rebirth or it could very well be being born for the first time. A lot of it is construction and the outskirts are littered with various mounds of rubbish.</p>

	    	<p>We’re not actually there yet, but we’re leaving tonight by way of train. Wuhan is located in the east-middle part of China at the convergence of some rivers. The weather varies between 77-97 degrees and they don’t eat a lot of meat.</p>

<p>Yesterday we ate a super fancy restaurant that Bush and Clinton ate at with Donna and Mrs. Yin’s very well-to-do friend. HAH! I beat Barack!</p>

<p>Not a whole lot has gone on, but we figured that if we update now, this gets us out of updating again for awhile in Wuhan, since we won’t have access to Internet outside of dingy webcafes. (uploading here is very slow…hopefully a lot of pictures next time - I’m at 700 or so right now)</p>

	    	<p>Our old hotel charged 4 yuan per minute, so of course that’s way too expensive. We’re now at the Howard Johnson on Nanjing Lu and are about to go out and wander around some more. A longer update to come, just wanted to let our loyal reader base know we’re not dead.
