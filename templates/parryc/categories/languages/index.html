	    	<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list">Swadesh List</a> is a list of base words that can be used for historical compartive linguistics.  It allows one to very quickly get up and running when delving into two different languages’ pasts. Sounds nice, doesn’t it? Not very useful for modern languages, though. Knowing how to say “hair”, “moon”, “earth” etc. is of little use when trying to order a beer in a pub in Bangkok or Moscow.  My goal here is to develop a list of phrases that once learned in the target language will allow you to get up and running as quickly as possible. Obviously, if a decent level of proficiency is desired, this can be used as a jumping off point months in advance of a journey.  However, it’s also meant to be used on a plane or bus hours or minutes before getting to your destination by turning and asking your neighbor.</p>

<p>The end goal is to have a list of sentences that include common words that are hard to ask about (e.g. how, why, when), common sentence structures (<em>I would like…</em>), how to describe things (<em>I want the thing you put the water in</em>), and most importantly, how to tell people that you are still a learner. With these sentences, you should also be able to get an introduction to the basic grammar you need to make sentences on the fly. Sure, it’d be cool if you knew how and when to use the vocative case in Scottish Gaelic, but it’s really not that important relative to being able to order <em>uisge beatha</em>.</p>

<p>Without further ado…</p>

	    	<p>Hungarian is a pretty cool language. It’s aggluntinating, which means you add person, tense, and all other sorts of markers directly to the stem of the verb. I’ll be using this page, and others, to chronicle my quest to learn Hungarian. Below, you’ll find two tools I’ve created to help me on my way: an inflector and an analyzer.  The inflector takes the root form (also called a lemma or dictionary form) of a verb and inflects it correctly. It assumes the word you’re inputting is Hungarian and applies rules according to the word’s character. The inflector does the opposite - put in a word you think is a Hungarian verb, click inflect, and hope it gives you something useful. Because of certain problems in naïvely doing morphological inflections, there will occasionally be ambiguous results.</p>
