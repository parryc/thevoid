	    	<p>Brennan is a science poet.  He is more than a poet - he has transcended words and writes with pure science (which look suspiciously like scribbles on the back of ripped manilla folders).  Brennan likely hasn’t showered in days.  Brennan is also staying in the same room as us.</p>

<p>This is his story.</p>

	    	<p>To set the scene for your reading: There are bunch of British people watching pizza and watching Space Jam in the hostel. This is like a horrible amalgamation of kindergarten, college, and my worst nightmares. Also, Richard Simmons. Dear God, what’s going on.</p>

<p>Some of you might be thinking: “Parry you haven’t updated this is days! There are so many things in London you had to have seen some of the things, if not a fair many things.” To this extent, there is truth in that statement, I have seen many things. Because you’re curious (or being forced to read this) I’ll let you know what they are:</p>

	    	<p><em>Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Sleeping on a Chair Next to a Gaggle of Africans in Heathrow for 5 Hours</em></p>

<p>My time in Londontown has come to an end and the last few days have passed in a blur (or…haze, depending). There have been crazy hobos, bent on stealing one’s kidneys, and there have been crazy undergrads, bent on stealing delicious muffins from string theory conferences. This trip has opened my eyes to many new things (e.g. that Jimothy really likes Smirnoff Ice) and closed them to many others (e.g. I will never, ever, have a good British accent).</p>

<p>To wrap up, I present to you the last bit of pictures from the trip. This opting out of writing more is definitely not because most of the last few days were trying to get Jimothy to drink more. That would have been a horrible thing for a group of friends to do. It was spent at museums (3 hour complete traversal of the British Museum? Probably a record…for better or worse). And uh… looking at statues. (Or, in one particularly great moment, when getting Jimothy to pose in front of a statue, an entire bus of Asian tourists pulled up in front of us and all started taking pictures of him).</p>

	    	<p>There comes a time in every young man’s life where home becomes like corset: slimming, made of whale bones, but ultimately, constricting. For me, that time is now. Well, technically, 3 hours from now.</p>

<p>I should back up, perhaps. I have three friends, let’s call them Jim, Bob, and Franz, to illustrate my friend group’s lack of ethnic diversity. Jim, Bob, Franz, and I have been friends since before we had enough mental faculty to realize that we probably should find other people to be friends with. Over the years, mutual hate has kept us together. And over these years we have planned countless times to do something epic and worth of the epicness contained in our friend group. Thus, we went to Duluth for a night. Which, when all was said and done, we realize was about par for the course when it came to 4 Minnesotans deciding to “road trip.”</p>
