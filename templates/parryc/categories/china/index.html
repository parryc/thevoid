<p>I am finally a foreigner again. I am back in the land of stares, discreet pictures, and lewd cat calls that result in me shaking peoples’ hands without a single exchange of words.</p>

<p>But best of all, I am back where a chubby little Chinese boy can come up to you, stick out his hand and say in impeccable British English “hello, how are you?” and not expect anything but a mumbled reply he’ll never understand.</p>

	    	<p>In the spirit of the Olympics, I have attempted to set a new record for “Longest Time Without Writing a Blog Post” – naw, just kidding. I’m just lazy. However, I have been using this time to “observe” (but don’t tell my boss, I’ve been telling him I’ve been programming).</p>

<p>As a commuter I spend a lot of time on the subway. I’ve mastered its tricks, its trades, and its stock exchange. I can do the Sleep-Until-Your-Stop, the No-Holds-Stand, the Doze-Off-Standing, and the Read-A-Book-In-Someone-Else’s-Hands. If there was a way to monetize these skills, I’d be rollin’ in the dough. (and subsequently wouldn’t have to ride the subway – you can see where I’m going with this.)</p>

<p>Independent of marketable skills, the Shanghai Metro has brought out my muse better than any Beatrice ever has. What I present to you below is my first work from what is likely to be part of my opus (in stores and Amazon soon!) comprised solely of unconnected ramblings written while sitting.</p>

	    	<p>I’m ashamed to admit that I have a problem. Well, I’m probably ashamed. I’m pretty sure shame is outlawed in China - and you know how good I am at avoiding breaking laws (hence why I no longer mail anything).</p>

<p>What is this problem?</p>

<p>I don’t know what the food I eat at restaurants looks like raw. I order something delicious, say “8 Splced Hevenly Chriken.” Chicken. I like chicken. I can say chicken and I can say meat. Hell, I even know what a chicken looks like in real life. Buying chicken at the super market should be easy as pie!</p>

<p>So I walk to butcher’s area of the supermarket and look at what they have to offer. Various organs (I think), various limbs (I think), various… things that I’m not entirely sure are meat, but are there anyways. Some pre-cut meat things that have pig stickers on them. I’m pretty sure that these are pork. But it’s China and the labels don’t actually say pork anywhere on them…so, maybe only 80% sure.</p>

	    	<p>This is going to be my last blog post in Harbin - and I figure I should write it now before I…study…this weekend. Finals are coming up and given that there is only one full weekend left together with all of these new friends, the sensible thing to do is study. You’ll know where to find me. In my “room.”</p>

<p>Ok, I lie. I may not be in my room. I might be in the Harbin Institute of Technology Science Park. For those of you don’t know what a Science Park, it’s like an Arboretum of Science. If you don’t know what an arboretum is, imagine model rockets and used boosters growing haphazardly out of the ground. Now why might I be there (besides the concept itself being awesome)? There are three reasons: I’ve started jogging, I love lilacs, and retired Chinese people are awesome.</p>

	    	<p>Every semester CET plans a rip-roaring adventure to some city other than Harbin, most likely in order to convince students that not all of China is cold.  The way they go about accomplishing this goal is actually quite clever: by going south. 12 hours south via train, to be precise.  Now you may be thinking “the title says land of opportunity, I was unaware NAME-OF-YOUR-COUNTRY (to appeal to a wider audience) was south of China.”  And you would be right, unless you’re from North Korea.  But you’re not. (If you are, please comment otherwise).</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, CET Spring Semester 2012 “Road” Trip was to Dandong, a large Chinese city on the North Korean border.  Now, clearly none of the activities involved crossing the border (unfortunately), but a lot of them involved looking at North Korea, which is surprisingly fun.  For instance, we got to look at North Koreans farm while we stood on a portion of the Great Wall.  We were literally a stone’s throw away. (If me throwing a stone into N. Korean broke any international laws, then I was figuratively a stone’s throw away). I now have the entire life of a North Korean cow documented. It mostly involves eating and drinking.</p>

	    	<p>There are sandstorms in Harbin. Which means that you should probably keep any and all eating utensils by an open window. I can guarantee that they will stay clean. At least most of the time, which you know, is really all that matters. I mean, when you think of it, you’re not even eating most of the time.</p>

<p>But this aside, I got back from a “whirlwind” “adventure” in “Zhejiang provence.” I say “whirlwind” because there weren’t any whirlwinds, “adventure” because I already knew where everything was, and “Zhejiang provence” cause I thought adding quotes made it looked “better.” On my escape from the salty North (seriously, pretty sure I saw a road-side stall that was selling potatoes, salt, and pineapples - you don’t need much else to make a traditional “Dongbei” dish), I got a chance to visit some old friends, make some new ones, and eat a lot of tasty food. But the most important thing is just that: “things.”</p>

	    	<p>Occasionally Chinese people will say “Oh My Lady Gaga!” as opposed to things like “Oh My!” Your guess is as good as mine.</p>

<p>Anywho, I have learned through in depth study that American study techniques and Chinese study techniques are wildly different. Most Chinese students (engineering students in particular) will go to the library, work for hours on end and have most, if not all of the material memorized, ready to ace the test. American students (sample size: me) will buy a lot of snack food, spend too much time trying to decide if Ritz crackers filled with yogurt are the best things or the worst things (they’re the best), and then take a four hour nap in the middle of the day.</p>

	    	<p>Walking around the streets and entering the shops of a foreign city is probably the best way to get acquainted with a new city. That and Wikipedia. But seriously, it’s great, you get to see all sorts of things that aren’t distilled and purified for easy consumption in language class. It also gives you a bunch of chances to make a dammed fool of oneself.</p>

<p>For example, purchasing things. I’d like to think that I have “mastered” the ability to read signs and purchase associated products. Apparently not in Chinese. One day I noticed that a store was having a sale on Kleenexes - perfect, I was running low. I go in, look at the sign, read the brand name and as I’m reading the rest of the sign reach out to grab a package of something that matches the part of the sign I’ve read so far. I look down and see a female employee giving me the strangest look. I look down and quickly drop the package of female sanitary pads I had just been holding so contemplatively. I then proceed to get lost in the same store for another 15 minutes and repeatedly pass the same employee who continues to stare at me with a strange mix of accusation and incredulity.</p>

<p>If you’re one of the many who don’t come from a miniature version of Siberia, I should probably clarify: for those who have never been to Harbin and plan on visiting during some time other than the two weeks they call summer, it’s not actually that cold. If anything, global warming has been good to Harbin. It’s significantly warmer this winter than it was last winter. I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to find the actual temperature (so as not to unduly scare people away).</p>

	    	<p>Perhaps due to their long and storied history, the Chinese have learned to eschew needless words and sentences. When they speak they speak with the weight of the greats like Confucius, Mencius, and those two guys who lip synced to Backstreet Boys on their shoulders.</p>

<p>For example, one day while running (yes, I’m as surprised as you are), one of the guards says “Oh, so you’re running.” Perhaps thinking “Dang, they move faster than I thought” or “Hm, 3pm is a good time for a fact.”</p>

	    	<p>Some of you may be thinking “Wow, Parry must be having a really awesome time, as he hasn’t updated his blog in DAYS.” For those of you who I am actively trying to impress, yes, my times are all awesome. For those of you who realize that most of what I do is mundane - I’ve been at work. For those of you who stumbled upon this by accident, go with the first one: I’m awesome.</p>

<p>Anywho, as much as I’ve tried to make programming as adventuresome as possible, there’s only so many ways to make it so. Most of those ways are obscure and hard to find and I have unfortunately haven’t found any of them. I think instead I’m going to go into archaeology - I’m not afraid of snakes and I’ve been told I look quite rugged, or at least like a rug, which has to count for something.</p>

<p>One thing that has made the days a little different is the fact that most of the company (and by most, I mean all. Because there are only 4 people other than the interns.) is involved in Ultimate frisbee. Last weekend was the Shanghai Invitational Ultimate tournament, of which I was the TD. What’s a TD you ask? My first guess was that I was a touchdown, a man who just by existing scored 6 points for my home team. Considering most of what I did consisted of running around with a megaphone and airhorn and trying to explain the concept of a waiver in Chinese, I don’t think my position was point based. I will assume that it means that I was the Tournament Director. Which is kind of cool.</p>

	    	<p>So some of you (Hi mom!) might be wondering why I haven’t updated in a week. I mean, I’m in a major city of a world power, there has to be Internet, right? This is where you would be sadly mistaken. The Internet, like nice hair, is something reserved for a select few in China, namely those who know the vocabulary for “that one thing you plug into your computer to get Internet.” Also, you need to fight a bear - they’ve become quite a problem for the Chinese.</p>

<p>After fighting said bear and having Annie just go ahead and buy said Internet-thing, I am now up and running, without the actual running - sedentary is (one of) my middle name(s). However, that’s not to say I don’t get sufficient exercise. There’s the 10 minute walk to the subway station, the 40 minutes of sweating along with all the other commuters and then another 10 minute walk to the office, where I sit and slow roast for 8 hours. If anyone has ever tells you that Shanghai is temperate (or any other word that indicates less than 100% humidity), slap them in the face. Even if you haven’t been here to confirm that, do it anyways. For me.</p>

<p>Ok, ok, so it’s not that bad, but it will be, I’m just trying to get you to commiserate with me early.</p>

This is interesting, because in theory it will be 95 degrees and humid all the time… Hm.</p>

Common ones in China include blind massages, massages by people with working eyes, massages with sad endings, massages with normal, non-sexual endings. You get the drift. I, however, not knowing the word for massage am worried as to the results when I try finding a massage parlor. I do, luckily, sort of kind of know how to use a map.

Tongxiang is only 62 km away from Shanghai, so in theory a bus would take around an hour (if one considers highway speeds here are 60-100kmh). However going anywhere dubbed “Shanghai” is like wading through molasses wearing lead weights on the Sun.</p>

<p>Anyways after who knows how long I actually made it there. Millie lives with her boyfriend and his parents in a very swank 2 floor apartment. The housing market in Tongxiang, while still exorbitantly priced is apparently affordable on a government official and school owner’s salary. Yeah, Millie’s not just a teacher, she actually owns the school she works at. Due to the dismal state of the Chinese education system (pupils hate their teachers and vice-versa), apparently most of the useful learning is done in private after-school schools. Jack, the boyfriend, is a government official who I think works on mangaging security for things. As an official, the government gives him money specifically to buy a house - hence the reason why it seems like government officials in China own 3 houses. They have nothing to do with that money but to buy houses.</p>

	    	<p>China is a land of many different things and what not. (My government and culture classes have been paying off, as you can tell) One thing thing they are full of, that on the surface you might not expect, is compliments. Case in point:

Patience is not just the name of the game, it is also the name of every action a player in the game can do. Hell, it’s the name of the player too.</p>

	    	<p>The Nationalist treason and plot.  I know of no reason, why the Communist win Should ever be forgot. On many military emblems throughout China has 八二 (8/2), signifying the Communist “Independence Day.”</p>

<p>Much of CCTV was filled with praise and glory and really bad Communist music for the defeat of the Nationalists 60 years ago.</p>

<p> Our last week was just as epic as the Communist celebration. We ate 狗肉, which I thought was fine, but it isn’t something I’d go out of my way to get. To be honest, in the range of “less commonly eaten animals,” donkey is a lot more delicious. Our culinary deliciousness does not compare to what we did for 3 days…</p>

	    	<p>Jilin is a city of many things: water, people drinking beer next to the water, 80 degree weather, and Packer fans (this one may or may not be true). With this in mind, imagine the level of activity and busyness that we’re experiencing. None. At all. The standard schedule is a combination of eating meals, playing DS, or in Kevin and my case, studying Chinese. The routine has, however, been broken up occasionally.</p>

	    	<p>We have recently arrived in Beijing, home of really really warm weather and deserted Olympic stadiums. The day was spent wandering around the Olympic village and wandering through the Bird Nest and Water Cube. To give you a good idea of what these are imagine yourself at the Metrodome and make the white grey and you have the Bird’s Nest. Imagine 4 pools in a cube, the Water Cube. We’ll be in Bejing for 5 days, but the Forbidden City and the Great Wall are tentative.</p>

	    	<p>Our first city is Bao An, located in the middle of nowhere. According to Mr. Yin, the only way to find it on a satellite map is if you knew where it was already and then looked for a giant lake thing…and then you’d be close. Bao An is a farmer’s town. It is surrounded by farms…which never seem to have anyone in them, and dirt and dense rainforest like jungles. The city itself is in the process of a rebirth or it could very well be being born for the first time. A lot of it is construction and the outskirts are littered with various mounds of rubbish.</p>

	    	<p>We’re not actually there yet, but we’re leaving tonight by way of train. Wuhan is located in the east-middle part of China at the convergence of some rivers. The weather varies between 77-97 degrees and they don’t eat a lot of meat.</p>

<p>Yesterday we ate a super fancy restaurant that Bush and Clinton ate at with Donna and Mrs. Yin’s very well-to-do friend. HAH! I beat Barack!</p>

<p>Not a whole lot has gone on, but we figured that if we update now, this gets us out of updating again for awhile in Wuhan, since we won’t have access to Internet outside of dingy webcafes. (uploading here is very slow…hopefully a lot of pictures next time - I’m at 700 or so right now)</p>
