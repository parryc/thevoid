## marbling tools

- any length and any spacing and any thickness tine

## bookbinding

- primarily functional cased designs
- able to do imposition (including 4to and 8vo)
- available for edition work

# marbling seconds

marbling seconds are those sheets that either have an error (e.g. air bubble), poor color palette, or other characteristics that make them undesirable for my own work. however, they may be perfect for what you're trying to do. seconds are sold at cost, in bundles of 5, thus $7.50 + shipping. size and color not guaranteed, but please reach out if you have something in mind – note, however, that it may be better suited for a commissioned marbling edition.

please email me at _parry@bookartbook.art_ with "marbling seconds" in the title if interested.
