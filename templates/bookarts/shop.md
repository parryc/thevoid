## marbling tools

> these combs are a game-changer - Heather Fletcher, author of _Making Marbled Paper_

my passion lies in making marbling tools to help the beginner and experienced marbler take maximum advantage of their time at the tank. i have made combs for the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, Midwest Marblers, individual marblers, and hopefully i will have a chance to make combs for you, too!

interested in a set or individual combs? write to me with the specifications for your tank (width and depth) and we'll get the show on the road!

- beginner sets (3", 2", 1", 1/2", 1/4") are available for $100
- microcombs (1/8" and 1/16") and bouquet combs are available for $35 each
- interested in something non-standard? let me know!
