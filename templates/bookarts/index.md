hello! my name is parry – i'm a marbler and bookbinder based in minnesota. this site is where i've collected projects and experiments of interest. some are complete, some are in a nascent stage, and most are in between. if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out at _parry@bookartbook.art_. you can find me elsewhere on the web at [parryc.com](https://parryc.com).

unsure of where to look first? take a peep at some [marbling examples](marbling-examples), learn about one of [my cross-discipline projects](a-momigami-jacket), or read up on [kyoseishi](kyoseishi).
