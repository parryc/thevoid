1. Determine amount of cloth
2. Determine which paper to use (Thai Kozo or a paper from Hiromi paper?)
3. Determine pattern and color
4. Learn how to join momigami'd cloth

# Preparing Paper
Using kyoseishi, since it has already been professionally strengthened with 2 coats already
- [x] Cut kyoseishi in half - from Hiromi Paper (24'' x 36''?)
- [x] Add 4 additional coats (~15 min per coat - 15min * 4 * 8 = 8hrs of prep) 
Coated 8 half-sheets (4 full sheets) 
- [x] Soften paper (~3x walks, so ~1.5hrs per sheet)
First prepare by rolling in a tube - short wise, flip sides, long wise, flip sides, diagonally, flip sides – scrunching lightly each way. This is my attempt to reduce tearing (which occurred in sheets 3 & 4)
After preparing the sheet, the method is to start a corner, scrunch up by pulling in the paper, then spreading it out and smoothing the creases. Repeat until soft enough – shouldn't feel startchy.
a good indication you are into the "soft" phase of the paper is when, when rolled into a tube, it is easy to squish the tube inwards, that is if there where a tube roller inside the rolled up paper, you could squish inwards along the tube.

(5/16 - 2 are done, so 6 * 3 * 30 min = 9hrs of scrunching, or 18 days of walks, damn)
- [x] check for holes and repair with tengucho

# Preparing Marbling Setup
- [x] buy a plastic marbling tub (from bunnyrabbit.net, 24'' x 30'')
- [x] buy welding rods to cut into tines for rakes
- [x] get wood for rakes (menards dowels, plus what I found downstairs)
- [x] get a board to hold paper on while washing
- [x] get bucket to hold water for rinsing? (used a small sauce pot)
- [x] get bucket to hold carageenan -- calcs look like ~2.5 gal will be needed minimum, so maybe need to make3.5 gal total?
## soap-less equipment
_for keeping soap from the marbling area_
- [x] blender
- [x] liquid measuring cup
- [x] dry measuring spoons
- [x] mixing bowl (for alum)

## actually make the rakes
- [x] 1"
- [x] 1/4"
- [x] remake 1/4'' with smaller rods -- the 3/32'' rods are too wide and push the carrageenan forward like a wave when using them
	- note that if the rake is not able to fully take up the width/length of the tray with its tines, it will create a backflow type thing, where the carageenan on the right and left will flow around the rake, like the wake of a boat -- an interesting effect, but not always desirable for more precise marbling
- [ ] ~~bouquet (1 x 2")~~
- [ ] ~~2''~~
- [x] buy alum spreading materials (microfiber wash mitt, spray bottle - bought from chemical guys)
- [x] practice making alum and carageenan and do a run through with other paper
first practice had fractal-ing inks which didn't spread well (not to mention in adequate carrageenan and the tray I used was not super well suited for it)
- [x]  practice making alum and carageenan and do a run through with other paper, again
	- Mary Holland alerted me to the issue - the carrageenan was still cold -- should be the same temp as the ink, so room temp. this time I took it out at noon after sitting overnight and let it get up to room temp before using it in the evening. made _way_ too much - probably could have gone with only 2 gallons or so, but made 4, lol

# Determine Clothes Pattern
- [x] make a large sheet of paper for tracing on to
- [x] trace kendogi (suit jacket is way too hard) and divide into sheets of paper
- [x] how should the area for sleeves gonna be done? vertical sheets or horizontal? (this might not actually matter, but it might be useful for some other "directional" designs)

# Marbling Paper
- [x] come up with a color scheme – this should probably be done in your practice runs. it's easier to just have one, so you don't have to worry about random colors appearing if you don't clean well enough
	- Prussian blue with a bit of black (5 drops), pearl, pearl+red mica, pearl+gold mica+a little red mica (for "rose gold", lol)
- [x] use the pattern to decide the direction of the patterns (write these steps out, start short, start long, etc.) and sketch out pattern ideas
	- 4-direction NP over stones -- flood with prussian blue, add stones of 3 addl. colors, push length, push width, pull length, pull width
	- looks sort of cloud-like - "clouds at sunset"
- [x] once you have the patterns set, then try your best at achieving that
- [x] the momigami will get stiff again after being marbled, so you'll need to set aside some time to re-soften it and check for holes again
	- about 5 min per sheet - full crumple, roll width x2, roll length x2, that thing where you fold it over and rub it against itself - width x2 then length x2

# Creating Jacket
- [x] practice sewing – is probably recommended to practice on a sheet of whatever paper is used (practiced backstich - don't forget to pin things, lol)
- [x] what kind of stitch to use? (backstitch)
- [x] ideally, buy/find some thai momi paper (cheaper and more prone to ripping than well prepared kyoseishi) and practice sewing. or if you have cloth, use that
- [x] if you're ok with the quality of the sewing, then start cutting your paper to your template
- [x] sew it all together
- [x] wear your jacket like a badass
# Future Investigation 
- Can you soften the marbled paper as well it was softened premarbling? 
- How soft does it need to be to be effectively marbled? (i.e. can you soften a little, marble, then soften a lot)
- Thoughts on how to strengthen the raw kyoseishi in the jacket structure itself
- Maybe buy an actual pattern and try again next year, lol. Once a year, trying to "perfect" the art
