marbling

[TOC]

most marbling patterns are described with pictures or diagrams, neither of which are super conducive to running text or reuse (unless you make a custom font – at which point you can't really copy and paste and send to anyone else). this is an attempt to systemitize marbled pattern descriptions using easily available computer characters. recommendations readily accepted for better characters to use!

# how to use

a pattern is described as a combination of either a base pattern + rake or a movement + rake. these combinations can be repeated multiple times to form increasingly intricate directions for use. each repetition should be separated by a semicolon. subsquent steps in opposite directions (away/towards; left/right) are assumed to bisect each other, unless an offset is explictly mentioned. a period has no meaning in the pattern and thus can still be used as a normal period (i.e. in running text).

## examples

### double cable

in inline notation: Ⓖ;↑②;⤻(¼");↓②;→②;⤻(¼");←②.

it can also be made a series of steps:

1. Ⓖ
2. ↑②
3. ⤻(¼");↓②
4. repeat 2 & 3 ⇄

### micro american

in inline notation: Ⓖ|➢;⟂¼;⟂¼.

that is, do a getgel or chevron, a nonpareil comb perpendicular to the last back and forth you just did, and then a nonpareil perpendicular to the nonpareil you just did.
