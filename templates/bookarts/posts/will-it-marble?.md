[TOC]

## handmade papers

some work, some don't. it tends to be quite easy to get air bubbles due to the stiffness. my own handmade paper says more about who made it (only me, at <abbr>MCBA</abbr> vs. with help from jim croft at _old ways 2022_).

- old ways 2022 ⭕
- st. armand ❌ (hard to get good coverage, but the colors can really pop on the white)
- vinczemill ❌
- <abbr>MCBA</abbr> western papermaking class ❌
- <abbr>MCBA</abbr> japanese papermaking class ❌

## washi

- tengucho 9g ⭕ (works best if a dry section is left out of the tank so there is an easily-grabbed stiff part of the paper to lift with. additionally, alum right before putting in tray.)
- kyoseishi [hiromi paper] ⭕
- the paper small desserts are placed on ⭕
- TN2751 [wet paint] (thai kozo) 🤷 (fibers tended to bunch when aluming)
- KH-62N [hiromi paper] 🤷
- hanaduri hanji notebook paper 🤷

# not paper

- icelandic poppy ⭕️
- balls of pulp - kozo / abaca ⭕️
- bookcloth 🤷 (does marble, but gets really curly - can it be ironed out? yes, sort of)
- legion cork paper ❌ (some curl dramaticallly – best to just use with the wood texture, rather than marble it)
- crash/super ❌
