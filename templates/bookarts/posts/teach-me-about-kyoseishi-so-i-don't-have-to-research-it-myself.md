aka, how i wrote all of what i know about kyoseishi into a book and tried to get people to annotate it, but it didn't really work, since kyoseishi is not a common material in the midwest (or probably anywhere at the moment), so no one had much to say.

20pp, unique, kyoseishi paper, boards covered in marbled indigo-dyed kyoseishi, contents include kakishibu-dyed, indigo-dyed kyoseishi, as well as other variations of konnyaku-stached washi for readers to feel. the back of the book is a guest book for readers to write in.

part of the Friedli Gallery 2023 book arts exhibition, as well as the Midwest Chapter of the Guild of Bookworker's [Modern Renaissance](https://midwestgbw.wordpress.com/exhibits/modern-renaissance/) online exhibit.
