# the quest for the microcomb

what is a microcomb? an enigma? an illusion? a dream within a dream? perhaps one day i'll find out, but for now, maybe it's what i've written below.

## can you make a 1/16" rake?

probably.

that is my first attempt: a 5" wide comb, with 1/16" spaced tines. the tines are [70-gauge stainless steel wire](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/128/4149). holes were hand-drilled with a [needle-nosed handdrill](https://www.micromark.com/Spiral-Push-Drill) – the chuck slipped occasionally, hence why the tines are of uneven length.

there are a few things at play here that leave me unfulfilled:

1) something about the tines are causing what appears to be too much paint being lapped up by the tines and causing streaks of carrageenan. i welcome any additional theories: currently my mitigating strategy is to try to put as little of the comb in the size as possible

2) as you can see, it is _very_ obvious where i deviated from the sixteenth of an inch progression

thus as a "standard" comb used like a non-pareil comb, there is still some experimentation to do. i'd like to try with 80 gauge wire – i've since gotten better at using the micro handdrill, so the uneven nature of the comb should be mitigated in the next go around.

## use as a free-standing rake

due to the small size of my test rake and the large size of the vat i was using (19 x 16), the next test i did was to use it like a stylus while making "fantasy" patterns. that is, free-form, not anchored to the sides of the tray.

i have been quite inspired by Norma Rubovits' "vignettes" (an example below) and endeavor to reproduce the technique to the extent i am able and it seems like a microcomb may have been used.

my own personal experiments have used the above rake as well as this tiny 5-tiner that i made while at studio.

for example, an attempt at a "vignette" with the 5-tiner.

some of the examples have worked better than others – it does seem like the 5-tiner would work well as a skip comb.

<picture><source srcset='/images/marbling/5_tine_skip.avif' type='image/avif'/><source srcset='/images/marbling/5_tine_skip.jxl' type='image/jxl'/><source srcset='/images/marbling/5_tine_skip.webp' type='image/webp'/><img src='/images/marbling/5_tine_skip.jpg' loading='lazy'/></picture>

here some additional "fantasy-esque" attempts with both the 5-tiner and the 5" rake. with the 5" rake i attempted to have the tines in the size as little as possible to avoid streaks, but that means that the wonky length of the various tines was much more obvious.
