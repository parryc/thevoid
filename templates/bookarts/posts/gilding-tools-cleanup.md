[TOC]

i've been lucky to find some gilding wheels on ebay for relatively cheap (certainly cheaper than new) and all in servicable condition. however, they've been pretty dirty, so thought this warranted a few comments on my clean up process.

you'll need:

1. 220 grit sanding block
3. 320 grit sanding paper
4. 600/1000 grind polishing pad
5. leather (horse butt or other good strop leather)
6. some <abbr>wd</abbr>-40 if desired

make sure to do this outside (and probably with a mask on, especially important if done inside!).

- if the base of the tool is particularly rusty, use the 220 grid sanding block to clean up the rust. _don't_ use this on the brass.
- transition to the 320 grit to clean up the base of the tool. it's probably unnecessary to use the 320 grit unless there's necessary reshaping of dents.
- use the polishing cloth on the edge of the wheel, you should go over the edge of the wheel until it glints in the sun.
- finish the edge by repeating the same steps of the 600 grit polishing pad with strop leather, much like you were finishing sharpening a knife.

i also recommend cleaning up the rust on the hardware holding the wheel to the handle. once cleaned up and reassembled, put a little <abbr>wd</abbr>-40 where the hardware meets the wheel and cleanup any overflow â€“ don't want oil to get anywhere it shouldn't be!
