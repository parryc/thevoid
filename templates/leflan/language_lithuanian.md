<attn>Feb 2022: As I have restarted my Lithuanian studies, this document is going to look a bit messy until all the sections have been re-reviewed for accuracy and formatting.</attn>

<attn>A note on _Accentuation_ subheadings: accentuation is complicated in Lithuanian, so it is certainly possible that the general notes here do not cover specific scenarios or exceptions. If they are missing an exception (or are completely wrong!), please send me an email so I can correct them, thank you!</attn>

# Nouns

## Grammatical Cases

NOM
: This is the default case and marks the subject of the sentence. When learning Lithuanian, it's important to learn the gender of the noun, as the case endings for NOM are not gender specific (cf. _-is_).

GEN
: Used for possession and is seen in compound nouns. Some verbs will mark the object in GEN, rather than ACC. In positive sentences, it indicates "some of" (the partitive) something, rather than all of it. Some things, such as languages, are almost always in the GEN since one can only ever do something to some amount of the object (e.g. one can only learn some of a language). When used for posession, the possessor is in GEN, the possessed in NOM. For example, Jonas' book (`Jonas:Jonas` `knyga:book`) becomes _Jono knyga_. In casual speech, some words that are not normally declined, such as `rytoj:tomorrow`, may find themselves with GEN endings. For example, <ex>_Perskaitykit šią knygą iki rytojaus_ ⧸ Read this book for tomorrow</ex>. Wishes are always expressed in GEN (<ex>_Gero vakaro_ ⧸ Good night</ex>).

DAT
: Often translated as "for". It may also mark the indirect object of a sentence. Colloquially, 2SG/2PL pronouns are dropped for DAT verbs.

ACC
: Often marks the object of the sentence.

INS
: Indicates with what the action is done. May be translated as "with", "by" (for transportation), or "along" (when discussing actions across surfaces, such as "along the road"). Some verbs also mark the object with INS, such as `tikėti:to believe in`.

LOC
: Marks the location an action takes place. When a living being is marked with LOC, it means "inside of".

VOC
: Used when calling out to a person, or poetically, to objects. It is always surrounded by commas (barring a left or right comma when at the beginning or end of a sentence).

<attn>Some words ending in _-ė_ will add _er_ before the ending, such as `duktė:daughter`, ex. _dukters_</attn>

<attn>Most words ending in _-uo_ will add _en_ before the ending, such as `akmuõ:rock`, ex. _akmens_. Less commonly, will the word add _er_, such as `sesuõ:sister`, ex. _seser̃s_.</attn>

There are a few patterns worth calling out, especially when getting started trying to memorize the declensions:

* ACC.SG is always a nosinė vowel (ą, į, etc.).
* With the exception of the common masculine endings, _-as/-is/-ys_, the GEN.SG ends in _-s_.
* DAT.SG always ends in _-i_, most often _-ui_.
* LOC.SG ends in _-je_ except for -as endings.
* GEN.PL always ends in _-ų_.
* DAT.PL always ends in _-ms_ – constrast this with INS.PL which always ends in _-(m)is_. I remember the difference by remembering that INS has I and S in it.
* ACC.PL always ends in _-s_.
* LOC.PL always ends in _-se_.
* The VOC.PL is the same as NOM.PL.
* -as/-is (m.)/-ys are mostly the same, but with an _i_ in _-is_ and _-ys_ to represent the palatalization of the stem (the "i-ness"). This retained "i" is not seen in ACC.SG because _ii_ and _iy_ are not valid dipthongs.
* _-a_ and _-ė_ are very similar: where _-a_ has "o", _-ė_ has "ė" and where _-a_ has "a", _-ė_ has "e".

## Pronouns

## Common Nouns Types

### Compound Nouns

When two nouns are placed together to form another noun, the first noun in the pair is in GEN and the second noun in the pair takes the appropriate case marking for its position in the sentence (ACC, INS, etc.).

Let's look at the word _peanut butter_ to illustrate this. A single peanut is literally an "earth nut", which means the word is: `earth:žemė` + GEN + `nut:riešutas` or `peanut:žemės rieǔstas`. _Peanut butter_ then is `peanut` + PL + GEN + `butter:sviestas`. This gives us then `žemės riešutų sviestas:peanut butter`. Note the PL – food stuffs are normally in the plural, since we're not making peanut butter from a single peanut.

One may find the order reversed (but the meaning the same), when the 2nd noun is a quantity, such as in <ex>_stiklinė sulčių_ ⧸ a glass of juice</ex>.

### Dimunitives/Hypercoristics

Dimunitives are an important part of the Lithuanian language. They can:

1. Add a sense of closeness to the subject or object
2. Give an emotional resonance to the sentence
3. Used ironically or sarcastically (such as asking `Kaip tavo atostogėlės?:How was your lil' trip?`, after a two month long holiday)
4. Derive new terms (now often fossilized forms, for example, `žibintas:lamp` + _ėlis_ = `žibintuvėlis:flashlight`)

To form the dimunitive form, one replaces the noun's ending with the dimunitive ending (those listed below are common ones, but it is not an exhaustive list). In many cases, it is the speaker's preference as to which diminutive form is used, though one may also be told that one form or the other sounds better. In this, as in many other cases, practice makes perfect.

* _-as/-is_ (m.) – (i)ukas, elis, ėlis
* _-is_ (f.) – aitė (also indicates an unmarried woman), aitis
* _-a/-ė_ – elė, ytė, (i)utė
* _-aitė_ – ė (indicates a woman's married status is unknown)

Note that in some cases, the adjectives describing a hypercoristic will also take the diminutive endings (_mažiukas puodukas_, a little cup).

--EX--
Namai namučiai
Home sweet home // Note that "home" (namučiai) has a different dimunitive that "house" (nameliai)
--ENDEX--

### Professions

+inikas/ė
: = one who does (zh: 者)

+tojas/a
: = one who does (zh: 者), derived from 3rd person present
: valgyti - valgytojas
: mokyti - mokytojas

+ėjas/a
: = one who does (zh: 者), derived from 3rd person past
: duoti - davo - davėjas

# Numbers and Quantities

Numbers match the object in both case and gender.

Teens or numbers ending in 0 (10, 100, etc.) are followed by GEN. Numbers ending in 1-9 are "used as adjectives and agree with the quantified noun in gender, case, and number"<cite>[Ambrazas §3.4](#Ambrazas)</cite>. Numbers ending in 1 are always followed by the singular.

* Dvidešimt viena gėlė (NOM.sg)
* Dvidešimt gėlių (GEN.pl)
* Dvidešimt trys gėlės (NOM.pl)
* Aš matau vieną katę (GEN.sg) (_because katė is in ACC., so is viena_)

Numbers above 10 are formed by adding the feminine ACC form of the tens place to the number ten (dẽšimt).
: dvidešimt, trisdešimt

Quantities are expressed by the quantity word + NOUN.GEN
: indẽlis grietı̇̀nės, gabaĺiukas pı̇̀cos

#### Nominative

M      | F
-------|------
vienas | vienas
du     | dvi
trys   | trys
-i     | -ios

e.g. keturi/keturios

#### Accusative

M      | F
-------|------
vieną  | vieną
du     | dvi
tris   | tris
-is    | -ias

e.g. keturis/keturias

# Verbs

The third person form of the verb determines which conjugation is used. Ex., if the verb ends in an _a_ it is the 1st conjugation.

Transitive verbs are usually followed by the ACC. However, if the verb is negative, it is followed by the GEN. Impersonal verbs do not change object case in the negative (e.g. _patinka_)

ex. _rašyti laišką_ vs. _nerašyti laiško_<cite>[365, pg19](#365)</cite>

The last verb before noun determines case, such as in _Aš noriu skaityti ACC_, rather than GEN, which _norėti_ requires.

If there is a dipthong (pure or mixed) in a multi-syllabic root, add an _i_ to the stem. If a pure dipthong, must be followed by a consonant other than _ti_. Thus, _baigti_ → _baigia_ and _laukti_ → _laukia_, but _not_ for _griauti_, since the dipthong is not followed by something other than _ti_.

Some verbs of quantity can either take ACC or GEN objects. When it the object is in GEN then the verb is an uncertain amount. For example, <ex>_Aš valgau obuolių_ ⧸ I ate some apples</ex> vs. <ex>_Aš valgau obuolį_ ⧸ I ate an apple</ex>. Note that this does not happen when the action (e.g. the verb) is the focus of the sentence, rather than the result (e.g. the object). In that case, the direct object will always be whatever the verb requires (most often ACC).

Verbs with _-io-_ or _-inė_ often involve or give the sense of process, repetition (_-io-_ form), or enjoyment (_-inė-_ form), especially when involving movement. Compare `bėgti:to run` and `bėgioti:to run around`. A verb will usually have one preferred form over the other 

## Infinitive (INF)

The infinitive is the standard dictionary form and ends in _-ti_. It is used much the same way as the English INF. In casual speech, the final _-i_ in the INF form is dropped.

## Present Tense (PRS)

There are three types of classes for verbs in the present tense. Which class a verb belongs to is dictated by the final vowel in the 3rd person. It is either _A_, _I_, or _O_, which can be remembered with the word _alio_.

Knowing the 3rd person conjugation gives you the stem, just remove the final vowel. 

Ex. _gyveña_ → stem:_gyven_, vowel:_a_

&nbsp; | A | I | O
-------|---|---|---
1SG    | -u|-iu| -au
2SG    | -i| -i| -ai
3SG    | -a| -i| -o
1PL    |-ame|-ime|-ome
2PL    |-ate|-ite|-ote
3PL    | -a| -i| -o

### Accentuation

In general, the accentuation of all forms follows the accentuation of the 3rd person. However, when the 3rd person either has:

* an accented penultimate syllable (exclusing REFL-suffix), which has a short vowel
* a raising tone

1SG and 2SG will both have an accented final syllable.

* `gãli:s/he can` → `galiù:I can`/`gali̇̀:you can`
* `skaĩto:s/he reads` → `skaĩto:I read`/`skaitaĩ:you read`

## Future Tense (FUT)

[stem] + _s_ + ending

&nbsp; |SG   | PL
-------|-----|-----
      1| -iu | -ime
      2| -i  | -ite
      3| ∅   | ∅

ex. li+s = (it) will rain, valgysiu = (I) will eat

Verbs with _ū_ or _y_ in the stem will have a short vowel in PST/FUT (cf. lyti → lis, būti → bus).

Depending on the ending of the stem, some combinations of s, z, š, or ž merge together

* s + s = s
* z + s = s
* š + s = š
* ž + s = š

### Accentuation

The accentuation pattern follows the accentuation of INF except for the 3rd person:

When the 3rd person's FUT form's _last_ (or only) syllable – ignoring the reflexive suffixe – is stressed with a falling tone (´), it is replaced with a rising tone (˜). For example, kalbė́ti → kalbė̃s.

## Past Tense

There are two past tenses in Lithuanian, the past simple (PST) and the past frequentative (PSTFREQ). The past frequentative is only used when it is an action that: 1) took place a long time ago, 2) was done throughout the whole time, 3) and was sometimes interrupted throughout that period.

### Past Simple (PST)

<attn>The stem of the verb can differ from PRS – make sure to learn the 3SG PST when learning a new verb.</attn>

There are 5 main endings in the past tense, based on the infinitive:

1. -auti/uoti – -avo
2. -oti – -ojo
3. -ėti – -ėjo
4. -yti – -ė
5. default -ė

This means that a verb like _kalbėti_ will be _kalbėjo_ in the 3rd person.

**Verbs ending in _o_ in 3rd person past**

&nbsp; | SG  | PL
-------|-----|------
      1| -au | -ome
      2| -ai | -ote
      3| ∅   | ∅

**Verbs ending in _ė_ in 3rd person past**

Note that if the verb stem ends in _t_ or _d_, in 1SG, it will be _-čiau_ or _džiau_ due to the palatalization (such as <ex>_Aš skaičiau_ ⧸ I read</ex>.

&nbsp; | SG  | PL
-------|-----|------
      1| -au | -ėme
      2| -ei | -ėte
      3| ∅   | ∅

#### Accentuation

In general, the accentuation of all forms follows the accentuation of the 3rd person. However, when the 3rd person either has:

* an accented penultimate syllable (exclusing REFL-suffix), which has a short vowel
* a raising tone

1SG and 2SG will both have an accented final syllable.

* `bùvo:s/he was` → `buvaũ:I was`/`buvaĩ:you were`
* `skaĩtė:s/he read` → `skaičiaũ:I read`/`skaiteĩ:you read`

### Past Frequentative (PSTFREQ)

Remove _-ti_ from INF and add _-dav_ and the appropriate suffix.

&nbsp; | SG  | PL
-------|-----|------
      1| -au | -ome
      2| -ai | -ote
      3| ∅   | ∅

#### Accentuation

Same as INF.

## Verbal Prefixes

Verbal prefixes can have two different impacts on an unprefixed verb. First of all, there is often one prefix that is the neutral perfective marker (see below for examples). The other is to slightly change the meaning, for which the list of prefixes below give the most common meaning for the prefix. Some dictionaries, especially those aimed at learners or foreigners, may list the perfective prefix for the verb, often under the unprefixed entry or as an IMP form. If a verbal prefix is used on one verb in a sentence, most often, a prefix should be used on other verbs in the sentence.

Compare for example, _Ryte aš atsikeliu_ and _Šiuo metu aš keliuosi_: the first, with a prefix means "In the morning, I wake up" - the action of waking up has a clear start and end in the context of the sentence. The second, without a prefix, is "Right now, I'm waking up" – the action of waking up has started, but has no clear ending in the context of the sentence.

As a result, the subsequent verbs in sequential strings of verbs often have a preverb, since the actions found in the infitive in English often are the full and complete action. One can see this in the difference between <ex>_Man rekia pasiruošti..._ ⧸ I need to prepare...</ex> and <ex>_Man rekia ruoštis..._ ⧸ I need to be preparing...</ex>.

For verbs that do not take a verbal prefix, it should be assumed that there is a different form that expresses continous action, e.g. `grįžti:to come back` and `grįžinėti:to be coming back`.

_at_ - coming (from there to here), e.g. *at*eiga, to come
_į_ - outward prefix, e.g. *į*sakyti, to command
_iš_ - leaving (from here to there)
_ne_ - not/NEG marker. May cause PERF prefix (whichever it may be for a verb) to be dropped.
_nebe_ - no longer
_pa_ - a little bit (for verbs of movement), e.g. *pa*lipti, climb a little bit
_per_ - across (for verbs of movement)
_pra_ - past (pratetis)
_pri_ - a lot; worked a lot at; excessively (often negative)
_pro_ - through (for verbs of movement)
_pu_ - 'somewhat', e.g. *pa*kalba, spoke a little
_si_ - reflexive, e.g. ap*si*gyventi, to settle oneself in (to a place)
_su_ - all together (PERF)
_tebe_ - still

## Moods

There are four moods in Lithuanian: 

1. Indicative
2. Subjunctive
3. Imperative
4. Oblique

Both clauses tend to use the same mood. Ex. _jei_ SBJV, _tai_ SBJV.

### Subjunctive (SBJV)

The subjunctive is used in the ways:

1. Hypothetical conditionals
2. Should, would, could
3. Expressing purpose

**Hypothetical Conditionals**

It is important to note that it is hypothetical, rather than real, conditionals that use SBJV. Real conditionals will use either FUT or PRS. For example, <ex>_Jei aš eičiau į šokių pamokas, tai būčiau lankstesnis_ ⧸ If I went to dance class, I'd be more flexible</ex>. Note, too, that both clauses use SBJV, in contrast to the English translation.

This is what Ambrazas refers to as the "simple subjunctive" – actions "which under certain circumstances would be possible or desirable in the present or in the future."<cite>[Ambrazas §5.47](#Ambrazas)</cite>

**Should, would, could**

Most commonly seen with `norėti:to want`, the subjunctive gives a sense of politeness to the sentence or question. As such, it is also often used when giving advice.

This gives rise to natural English translations for some common verbs:

*Should*: reikėti or turėti
*Could*: galėti
*Would*: any other verb in SBJV

--EX--
Ar tu galėtum man atnešti stiklinę sulčių?
Could you please bring me a glass of juice?
Aš norėčiau, kad (tu) ateitum anksti.
I would like you to come early.
Tu turėtum būti griežtesnis mano tarimui.
You should be more strict with my pronunciation.
--ENDEX--

#### Conjugation

Formed by removing the _-ti_ from the infinitive.

&nbsp; | SG    | PL
-------|-------|------
      1| -čiau | -tume/tumėm/tumėme
      2| -tum(ei) | -tumėt/tumėte
      3| -tų   | -tų

For 1PL and 2PL, the shorter forms are often used in speech, while the longer may be seen in written works.

### Imperative (IMP)

<attn>Excluding the verbal prefix (when applicable) is often considered rude, so make sure to include it!</attn>

Formed by removing the _-ti_ from the infinitive. This form is easily recognizable due to the _k_ in the affix. Note there is no 1SG or 3P forms.

&nbsp; | SG   | PL
-------|-------|------
      1| n/a  | -kim(e)
      2| -k   | -kit(e)
      3| n/a  | n/a

Note that the combination _g+k_ becomes _k_, ex. _raugti_ > _raugk_ > _rauk_!

Colloquially, the 1PL form (_Let's..._) can also be the 1PL.PRS without the ending _-e_. Thus, `varom:let's go`/`einam:let's go`.

In terms of politness, IMP is less polite than SBJV and IMP without a verbal prefix is less polite than IMP with a verbal prefix, as noted at the top of this section.

### Usage Notes

* _eiti_ is specifically to go by foot, _važiuoti_ is to go by some sort of wheeled transportation. Like a scooter, or wheelies.
* The _-iškai_ form for languages is _only_ used with `kalbėti:to speak`.

## Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs have the ending _-is_. Whenever there is a prefix, such as in the negative, one must use the _si_ prefix, ex. _praustis_ > _nesiprausti_).

There are 5 types of reflexive verbs:

1. Hygiene or self-care (`prausti:to wash something` vs. `praustis:to wash oneself`)
2. Active vs. static (`nešti:to carry` vs. `neštis:to hold`)
3. Internal action (`sukti:to rotate an object` vs. `suktis:to rotate oneself`, e.g. the earth rotates on its axis)
4. Speech related (`kalbėti:to speak` vs. `kalbėtis:to speak with each other`)
5. Internal feelings (`džiaugtis:to be happy`)

Reflexive forms are formed like non-reflexive verb, but with an additional suffix, as listed below. For plural forms, drop the final _-e_, ex. _dirbame_ → _dirbamės_.

One may use the reflexive pronoun to emphasize the action being done is for oneself, in exclusion to others. If no reflexive form of the verb exists, than using the reflexive pronoun is sufficient.

### Present Tense (PRS)

&nbsp; |SG      |PL
-------|--------|------
      1| -(o)si | -ės
      2| -(e)si | -ės
      3| -si    | -si

A/I verbs use the vowel in parentheses for 1SG and 2SG, O verbs do not. For example, _šukuojiesi_ vs. _maudaisi_.

### Past Simple (PST)

Add endings to non-reflexive stem.

&nbsp; |SG   |PL
-------|-----|------
      1| -si | -mės
      2| -si | -tės
      3| -si | -si

For example, _šukavausi_ and _šukavomės_. Same conjugation for both O and Ė past tense verbs.

### Past Frequentative (PSTFREQ)

Add endings to non-reflexive stem.

&nbsp; |SG   |PL
-------|-----|------
      1| -si | -mės
      2| -si | -tės
      3| -si | -si

### Future Tense (FUT)

&nbsp; |SG      |PL
-------|--------|------
      1| -osi   | -ės
      2| -esi   | -ės
      3| -si    | -si

### Subjunctive (SBJV)

&nbsp; |SG      |PL
-------|--------|------
      1| -si   | -ės
      2| -eisi   | -ės
      3| -si    | -si

### Imperative (IMP)

&nbsp; |SG   |PL
-------|-----|------
 all # | -is | -ės

# Prepositions

Most prepositions require the GEN.

## Prepositions in GEN

See also [DBK, pg293](#DBK).

* abipas - on both sides
* anàpas - on the other side
* anót - according to
* añt - on; expressing feelings towards smth; exactly at a time (coll.)
* àrti - close to
* bè - without
* daug - a lot of
* dėl - due to
* iki - to
* įstižai - diagonal
* iš - out of; from (a place – see _nuo_); since (movement from in to out)
* link - towards
* mažai - a bit of
* nuõ - from (a surface, outside of - no movement), paired with _iki_ for time or list-like expressions like "from... to..."
* põ - after
* prie - next to
    * Some locations use _prie_ rather than _į_ when the physical act of being at the location is next to it, rather than in it. For example, _Aš važiouju prie vandenyno_ vs. _Aš važiouju į vandenyną_ (I traveled [to be] next to the ocean vs. I traveled into the ocean).
* skersai̇̃ - across
* tarp - between
* vidury - in the middle of
* vietoj - instead of

V + už - take/grab už N.
: Ji pàšmė manè ùž rañkos - _She took me by the hand_

## Prepositions in ACC

* apiẽ - around, about (e.g. when referring to time)
* apliñk - around by (physical location only)
* į̇̃ - in (location/place); into (will often cause the verb to take the same prefix)
* pas - to a person
* per̃ - through; across; during; throughout; over (over the fence); for the duration of; via/on (for technology, e.g. via Skype, on TV)
* põ - round about; through (through the fence); after (time wise); around (both physically in a circle and metaphorically, like "around the city")
* prieš - opposite of, across from, before
    * with time it means _ago_, such as _prieš savaitė_, a week ago. _Prieš dvi valandos aš valgau jogurtą su serbentais_.

## Prepositions in INS

* põ - under
* su - with (will often cause the verb to take the same prefix)

# Adjectives

<attn>Adjectives match a noun's case, gender, and number.</attn>

For impersonal or state of being statements, use a neuter adjective. Neuter gender adjectives are the same as masculine gender adjectives, but drops the final _s_ (_geras_ → _gera_). Accent stays in the same spot.

* Man yra gera - I feel good
* Jam yra liūdna - He feels sad
* Man yra linksma - I feel happy
* Yra karšta lauke - It is hot outside

Note that colors are used by themselves (e.g. not modifying anything like the phrase "_black and white_"), they are always feminine, thus _juoda ir balta_.

## Declensions

There are three declension paradigms for adjectives in Lithuanian. The 3rd declension, which is used to describe "made of"/"belonging to" (e.g. `medinis:made of wood, wooden`) has some unique properties, which are described further below.

At a glance, here are the nominative endings for the declensions.

Declension|SG M | SG F | PL M | PL F
----------|-----|------|------|-------
1st       | -as | -a   | -i   | -os
2nd       | -us | -i   | -ūs  | -ios
3rd       | -is | -ė   | -iai | -ės

### First Declension

For masculine nouns, use the _-as_ form and for feminine nouns, use the _-a_ form. Thus, laimingas vyras (SG M), laiminga moteris (SG F), laimingi vaikiai (PL M), laimingos mergaitės (PL F).

 case   | -as | -a
 -------|-----|-----
 NOM.SG | -as | -a
 GEN.SG | -o  | -os
 DAT.SG | -am | -ai
 ACC.SG | -ą  | -ą
 INS.SG | -u  | -a
 LOC.SG | -ame| -oje
 VOC.SG | -as | -a
 –––––––|–––––|–––––––
 NOM.PL | -i  | -os
 GEN.PL | -ų  | -ų
 DAT.PL |-iems| -oms
 ACC.PL | -us | -as
 INS.PL | -ais| -omis
 LOC.PL |-uose| -ose
 VOC.PL | -i  | -os

### Second Declension

For masculine nouns, use the _-us_ form and for feminine nouns, use the _-i_ form. Thus, sunkus vyras (SG M), sunki moteris (SG F), sunkūs vaikiai (PL M), sunkios mergaitės (PL F).

This declension is very similar to the 1st declension, but with the addition of the palatalizing _-i_ before most endings.

 case   | -us | -i
 -------|-----|-----
 NOM.SG | -us | -i
 GEN.SG | -aus| -ios
 DAT.SG | -iam| -iai
 ACC.SG | -ų  | -ią
 INS.SG | -iu | -ia
 LOC.SG |-iame| -ioje
 VOC.SG | -us | -i
 –––––––|–––––|–––––––
 NOM.PL | -ūs | -ios 
 GEN.PL | -ių | -ių   
 DAT.PL |-iems| -ioms
 ACC.PL | -ius| -ias
 INS.PL |-iais| -iomis 
 LOC.PL |-iuose| -iose
 VOC.PL | -ūs | -ios 

### Third Declension

Adjectives in this declension mean "made of" or "belonging to". A common example is _medinis_, from `medis:wood`, thus "made of wood; wooden". Many random nouns can be made into a 3rd declension by adding _-inis_, such as `protas:brain` → `protinis:made of/belonging to the brain`.

For masculine nouns, use the _-is_ form and for feminine nouns, use the _-ė_ form. Thus, medinis vyras (SG M), medinė moteris (SG F), mediniai vaikiai (PL M), medinės mergaitės (PL F).

Third declension adjectives differ from 1st and 2nd declensions in a few ways:

* cannot form adverbs
* non-comparable (e.g. no "more wooden")
* cannot form pronominal adjectives
* there is no neuter gender form

Note that a number of 3rd declension adjectives also are the same as nouns, ex. _stiklinė_ means both "made of glass, SG F" and "a glass".

 case   | -is | -ė
 -------|-----|-----
 NOM.SG | -is | -ė
 GEN.SG | -io | -ės
 DAT.SG | -iam| -ei
 ACC.SG | -į  | -ę
 INS.SG | -iu | -e
 LOC.SG |-iame| -ėje
 VOC.SG | -is | -ė
 –––––––|–––––|–––––––
 NOM.PL | -iai| -ės
 GEN.PL | -ių | -ių
 DAT.PL |-iams| -ėms
 ACC.PL | -ius| -es
 INS.PL |-iais| -ėmis
 LOC.PL |-iuose| -ėse
 VOC.PL | -iai| -ės

## Comparison

All adjectives form comparative and superlative forms regularly.

**Comparitive degree (more)**

Drop ending, add suffix _-esn_, and then _-is_ for masculine adjectives and _-ė_ for feminine adjectives. Masculine: `geras:good` → `geresnis:better`, feminine: `gera:good` → `geresnė:better`.

To say something is "more X (adj.) than Y (noun)", there are three forms:

* X už Y (ACC)
* X nei Y (NOM)
* X negu Y (NOM)

The _nei_ form is used with shorter words than _negu_, though there isn't a strict cut off for what is considered "short".

**Superlative degree (most)**

Drop ending, add suffix _-iaus_, and then _-ias_ for masculine adjectives and _-ia_ for feminine adjectives. Masculine: `geras:good` → `geriausias:best`, feminine: `gera:good` → `geriausia:best`.

## Pronominal Adjectives

Pronominal (also known as "definite" or "norminal") adjectives serve two functions: they can act as a way of emphasizing the adjective (ex. the _red_ one) or standing in place of the noun in its entirety (ex. the _red one_). In English, this distinction is not entirely clear, but as seen in the preceding examples, mostly corresponds with the use of "the" before an adjective+noun pair.

As with normal adjectives, pronominal adjectives also match in case, gender, and number. The declensions for pronominal adjectives are based on the adjectival declension. That is, a first declension adjective follows the first declension list below. Third declension adjectives cannot form pronominal adjectives.

Baltoji Drobulė
The White Shroud // by Škėma

 -------|-------|-----
 NOM.SG | -asis | -oji
 GEN.SG | -ojo  | -osios
 DAT.SG | -ajam | -ajai
 ACC.SG | -ąjį  | -ąją

 ACC.PL | -uosius | -ąsias
 INS.PL | -aisiais| -osiomis
 LOC.PL |-uosiuose| -osiose
 VOC.PL | -ieji | -osios

### Second Declension

Similar to normal adjectives, the 2nd declension often has an _-i-_ at the beginning of the suffix.

 case   | -usis | -ioji
 -------|-------|-----
 NOM.SG | -usis | -ioji
 GEN.SG | -iojo | -iosios
 DAT.SG | -iajam| -iajai
 ACC.SG | -ųjį  | -iąją
 INS.SG | -iuoju| -iąja
 LOC.SG |-iajame| -iojoje
 VOC.SG | -usis | -ioji
 –––––––|–––––––|–––––––
 NOM.PL | -ieji | -iosios
 GEN.PL | -iųjų | -iųjų
 DAT.PL |-iesiems| -iosioms
 ACC.PL |-iuosius| -iąsias
 INS.PL |-iaisiais| -iosiomis
 LOC.PL |-iuosiuose| -iosiose
 VOC.PL | -ieji | -iosios

# Adverbs

* trupuitį - a little
* biški - a little (coll., from German _einbishen_)
* kartu - together
* vėl - again
* gal - maybe
* dar - still
* kol - while
* kol kas - so far (kol kas jam klasė labai patinka - so far he likes the class)

## Comparison

Comparative ends in _-iau_, superlative ends in _-iausia_
: gerai > geriau > geriausia

## Formation

Adjective ending | Adverbial ending
-----------------|--------------------
-as              | -ai
-us              | -iai
-is              | no adverb

_-is_ does not form an adverb because it was dervied from a noun originally. For example _medinis_ (wooden) – the adjectival form that is productive is _mediniškas_, which becomes _mediniškiai_.

## Of Motion

Motion            | Positional
------------------|------------
laukań (outward)  | laukè (outside)
aukštyñ (upwards) | aukšta (up; in a high place)
žemyn (downwards) | žemai̇̃ (down; in a low place)
tolỹn (farther on; into the distance) | toli̇̀ (far; at a distance)
namõ (homewards)  | namiẽ (at home)

Aš einù laukañ vs. Aš esu laukè
I am going outside vs. I am outside

# Time

Singular time nouns are in the ACC.
: vasãra - Vasãrą aš... - In summer I... 

...Except for _rytoj_ and _vakar_
: DAT - _ryte_ and _vakare_

Repetitive time and plural time expressions use INS.

## Telling Time

There are two main ways of telling time: listing all of the components (one thirty seven), or describing the time relatively (seven after half of two).

Relative time uses two prepositions, _be_ for before, and _po_ for after. _Be_ is used from :35 to :00 and _po_ is used from :00 to :25. Both take the genitive.

Exact hours (1:00, 2:00...) use oridnal numbers, ex. 1:00 _yra pirma_, 4:00 _yra ketvirta_.

Do not decline minutes when the time expression should be in ACC (such as in an "at ... o'clock" expression. No reason, just cause. Ex. at 4:35 - penkios po pusės penkių 

### Examples

_yra..._

* 4:15 - keturious (valandos) ir penkiolika (minučių)
* 10:25 - dešimt valandų ir dvidešimt penkios minutės
* 11:11 - vienolika valandų ir vienolika minučių
* 2:33 - dvi valandos ir trisdešimt trys minutės
* 1:35 - _pirma_ valanda ir trisdešimt penkios
* 10:15 - penkiolika po dešimt; po dešimt penkolika
* 10:45 - be penkilikos vieniolika 
* 2:05 - penkios po dviejų
* 4:47 - be trylikos penkios
* 2:30 - pusė trijų (quantity word _pusė_ takes GEN)
* 4:30 - pusė penkių
* 10:30 - pusė vieniolikos
* 6:26 - be keturių pusė septynių
* 7:37 - septynios po pusės aštuonių

_kada sustinkame?_, expecting an "at ... o'clock" reply

* at 9:30 - pusę dešimt
* at 11:45 - be penkiolikos dvyliktą
* at 2:00 - antrą (valandą)
* at 4:25 - be penkių pusę penkių
* at 4:35 - penkios po pusės penkių

Colloquially, the number may be in GEN, ex <ex>_pusę dešimtos vakare_ ⧸ 9:30pm</ex>.

## Days of the week

Cardinal number + _dienis_

* Primà (Monday)
* Antrà
* Trečià
* Ketvirtà
* Penktà
* Šeštà
* Septinskà

## Months

1-3      | 4-6       | 7-9       | 10-12
---------|-----------|-----------|-----------
saũsis   | balañdis  | lı̇́epa     | spãlis

# Questions

There are four main categories of question words in Lithuanian:

1. Yes-No Questions
2. Non-Declinable Question Words
3. Declinable Question Words
4. Case-Based Question Words

The first section below contains "Yes-No Questions" and "Non-Declinable Question Words", as they are easily listed. Each "Declinable Question Word" has its own section, as do the "Case-Based Question Words".

Generally speaking, the question word, regardless of what type it is, will come first in the question.

**Yes-No Questions (_ar_/_gal_)**

Questions without question words (aka Yes-No questions) must start with _ar_ or _gal_. _Ar_ is for simple yes-no questions:
 <ex>_Ar tu gyveni Berkelyje?_ ⧸ Do you live in Berkeley?</ex> Whereas `gal:maybe` gives a sense of both a sense of being unsure of the response and moderate politeness (akin to starting a question in English with _perhaps_): <ex>_Gal turi ugnies?_ ⧸ Perhaps you've got a light (for a cigarette)?</ex>

**Non-declinable Question Words**

kada - when
: <ex>_Kada tu gimei?_ ⧸ When were you born?</ex>

kaip - how
: Expects adverbial response
: May be better translated as "what", where Lithuanian responds with an adverb, where as in English, one would not: <ex>_Kaip žmones kalba? - Žmones kalba angliškai_ ⧸ What do the people speak? - They speak in English.</ex>

kiek - how much (GEN)
: <ex>_Kiek paukščių tu matai? - _Keturis_ ⧸ How many birds did you see? - Four.</ex>

kieno - whose
: <ex>_Kieno sūnus yra tas berniukas?_ ⧸ Whose son is that boy?</ex>

kodėl - why
: May jokingly be responded with `todėl:just because`.

o - used like English "and" in follow-up questions (e.g. "and you?") – _do not_ use _ir_ or similar words
: <ex>_O tu?_ ⧸ And you?</ex>

## Kas and Its Cases

`kas:what` declines based on its location in the sentence. Knowing the form of _kas_ also will let the speaker know in most cases what the case of the response should be. The declined forms are as follows, with additional notes as to their usage underneath.

**kas / NOM**

Often used with DAT verbs (<ex>_Kas tau labiausiai patinka Paryžiuje?_ ⧸ What do you like the most in Paris?</ex>) or the colloquial expression _Kas čia per x?_ (what is this _x_?).

**ko / GEN**

Used with negative questions and verbs taking GEN objects (`norėti:to want`, `ieškoti:to look at`, etc.). May also be an abbreviated form of `kodėl:why`.

**kam / DAT**

May also be an abbreviated form of `kodėl:why`.

**ką / ACC**

**kuo / INS**

Also used with verbs that take INS (`tikėti:to believe`, `groti:to play an instrument`, etc.)

**kur / LOC**

When used with a preposition, _kur_ may not come first in the sentence: <ex>_Iš kur tu esi_? ⧸ Where are you from?</ex>

## Declinable Question Words

### Koks/kokia

_Koks_ functions much like a question. Or perhaps it is better to say, given its normal translations of "what, what kind of", it is likely to be conflated with a question to English learners, since "what, what kind of" would all be described as question words. Textbooks etc. will mark it as a pronoun, but I don't know if that formal distinction actually helps.

To me, _koks_ and its declensions are best thought of as meaning "what kind of" and thus pair with a noun when used in questions. Note that while in English the question of "what kind of" almost always expects an adjective as a response, Lithuanian will often expect a noun.

Which is your cap? - Black, I am Little Black Riding Hood.
Kuriomis pasakomis tiki? - Pasaka!
In which fairytales do you believe? - All of them!
--ENDEX--

### Kelintas/kelinta (at which)

"At which" is kind of a clunky translation. This question asks at which point someone is in a list or row of numbers. That is, the situation must be enumeratable.

For example, in <ex>_Kelintas tu eilėje?_ ⧸ What place are you in line?</ex>, the line is enumeratable – there is a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. place in line – and the answer expects which of those places you are (e.g. `dešimtas:10th`).

# Conjunctions

> The clause introduced by *bèt* also denotes in some clauses something which is unexpected in view of the meaning of the main clause<cite>[DBK, pg305](#DBK)</cite>

_bèt_ is more emphatic than _õ_

_ar_ can be used to mean "whether"
: Aš nežinau, ar jiems patinka medus

Like a lot of European langauges, Lithuanian puts a comma before a clause. This _does not_ indicate a pause or anything like in English.

Aš nežinójau, kàd jis čià - _I didn't know that he is here_

# Pronunciation

* Palatalized /_t_/ always becomes 'č' before a back vowel
* Palatalized /_d_/ always becomes 'dž' before a back vowel
* C<em>e</em>C : /e/
* _ai_$ : /ei/
* ^u : /ɔ/, in load words, such as _universitete_

## Colloquial speech

* Will leave _i_ off at the end of verb ex. sužvejot*i* vs. sužvejot 
* _tai yra_ can be ellided to _tyra_

## Pitch Accent

There are three types of accentuation marks:

1. ̀ = accent is on a short vowel that is _always_ short (stressed)
2. ´ = accent is on a long vowel that in this case can be short (_a_ or _e_) (falling)
3. ˜ = accent is on a long vowel that is _always_ long or consonant in a mixed dipthong (rising)

Some vowels will change pronunciation depending what part of the dipthong is accented.

au
: _aũ_/_au_ = /oː/
: _áu_ = /au/
: the "real" phonology is obviously much more complex than this, but what's listed is close enough. The main thing to know is that rising (̃) and accentless are pronounced the same.

e
: _ẽ_ = /æ/
: _e_ = /ɛ/

ei
: _ei̇̃_ = /eɪ/
: _éi_ = /æɪ/

eC (mixed dipthong)
: _él_ = /æl/
: _el̃_ = /ɛl/

### Accent shifting for nouns

Per [HJ](#HJ-5-7).

There are two types of accents, _tvirtapradė_ and _tvirtagalė_, and four accentuation patterns, which I will call ①, ②, ③, & ④. 

_Tvirtapradė_ ("firm beginning") means that the accent is on the first part of a dipthong. Patterns ① and ③ deal with tvirtapradė accentuation.

_Tvirtagalė_ ("firm ending") means that the accent is on the second part of a dipthong. Patterns ② and ④ deal with tvirtagalė accentuation.

### Tips

Per [HJ](#HJ).

1. All ACC.S cases end in V nosine, ex. _kãtę_, and are never accented
2. GEN.S ending with "o" never accents finaly syllable, ex. _brólio_, _nãmo_
3. NOM.P ending with "s" never has accent on last syllable, ex. _sū́nūs_, _kãtes_
4. All NOM.S ending in "ys" are always accented, ex. _arklỹs_
5. All NOM.S ending in "(i)as" are never accented.
6. DAT.S final syllable is never accented.
7. VOC ending in just "e/a/i" is not accented.

### Syllable structure

Contrary to most methods, Lithuanians count syllables from the end of the word. There are two things to keep in mind: 1. the ending counts as 1 syllable, even if it's pronounced as two (e.g. _yje_). 2. the last syllable of the stem is the most important. (Why? We'll find out later!)

# Sentence Structures

Use _negi_ to emphasize/indicate surprise of a sentence
: Nègi nežinai? _You don't know??_

When _ir_ follows a verb at the beginning of a sentence, it functions as "also"
: Suprasta ir - S/he also understands...

Expressing age
: NOM yra NUM.GEN, _Mano sesė yra 22-ių_
: DAT yra NUM.NOM, _Mano sesei yra 22 metai_

benè - is it really.../could it be...?
jùk - but (interchangeable with gi̇)

## Conditional sentences

Conditional sentences use the same tense in both clauses

Jei rytoj lis, reikos skėčio
: If tomorrow rain+FUT, need+FUT umbrellas

## Clause Connections (ir, o, and bet)

There are three ways to connect clauses, each with slightly different uses. Correct usage is something that is difficult for learners and just needs to be learned by practice and repeated exposure to the language.

ir
: Closest to a neutral "and" in English, implies that the two clauses are similar in tone or idea. For example, <ex>_Mano draugui/draugei ir man patinka valgyti cepelinus_ ⧸ My friend and I like to eat cepelinai</ex>. Note that `bei:and` is used between similar words, rather than between clauses, especially as a way to avoid repeating _ir_.

o
: Could be translated by "and" or "but", _o_ is used to indicate contrasting clauses. <ex>_Man patinka valgyti cepelinus, o mano draugui - sumuštinius_ ⧸ I like to eat cepelinai, but my friend (like to eat) sandwiches</ex>.

bet
: More strongly contrastive than _o_. <ex>_Kasdien einu į biurą bet, man nepatinka dirbti ten_ ⧸ Everyday I go to the office, but I don't like working there</ex>.

## Passive Voice

See also [DBK, pg268](#DBK).

Uses _būti_ as auxiliary verb

àš esù mùšamas - I am being beaten
: I PRS PRS.PT

àš esù mùštas - I am beaten
: I PRS PST.PT

àš buvaũ mùšamas - I was being beaten
: I PST PRS.PT

àš buvaũ mùštas - I was beaten
: I PST PST.PT

## Fixed Phrases

{DAT pronoun} patinka + NOM
: Man patinka... - I like... 
: Can also use _mėgti_ - to like

Man tas pats - 无所谓

# Miscellaneous

Can use a man's first name in the plural to refer to the man's family.

## Spelling

_d_ or _t_ when pallatalized and followed by a vowel become _dž_ and _č_ respectively.

Ex. _medis_ > _medžio_, _viešbutis_ > _viešbučio_

Native Lithuanian words do not contain double "e", whereas international words may include them.

## Interjections

begėdis - shame on him!
eik velniop - go to hell!
_(niop is an older form of 'home')_
eik, eik - wow!
eik tu sau - no kidding!
màt tavè dievai̇̃ - may the gods take you!
nėra už ką - you're welcome, don't mention it
puiku! - great
prašo - please
prašom - you're welcome
velnią minint - speak of the devil

## Language notes

_Lietuva_ is the sanem root as rain (_lietus_)
báltas - white; bal̃tas - Baltic tribe

Compound words usually have rising stress in the joining vowel (when it's _not_ a dipthong), eg. antrãdienis vs. savàitgalis
