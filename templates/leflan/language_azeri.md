# Vowel Harmony and Consonant Assimilation

<attn>All suffixes with vowel harmony or consonant assimilation will be written in capitals, ex. `-lAr` exhibits `a/ə` harmony.</attn>

There are two main attributes of vowels that are important for Azeri: front vs. back and rounded vs. unrounded. Endings require one or both of these distinctions to match, depending on the vowel in the suffix, which must match the final vowel in a word.

&nbsp; | rounded | unrounded
-------|---------|-----------
front  |  ü ö    | i e ə
back   |  u o    | ı a

Vowel wise, there are two main distinctions in endings:

* `a` vs. `ə` based on front/back
* `i` vs `ı` vs `u` vs `ü` based on front/back, rounded/unrounded

Thus `qələm:pen` → `qələmlər:pens` or `kitab:book` → `kitablar:books`. 

Consnant assimilation happens in two capacities:

1. As part of a suffix
2. Depending on the final consonant of a word and the first consonant of a suffix

**Part of a suffix**

Some suffix's final consonant will change based on the front/back-ness of the vowel. Thus if it is a front vowel, the consonant will be `k` and if back, the consonant will be `q`. For example, with `Biz sürücüyIQ:We are drivers` → `Biz sürücüyük`, first the `I` turns to `ü` because the last vowel `ü` is front and rounded. Secondly, the `Q` turns to `k` because `ü` is a front vowel.

**Based on final consonant**

If a suffix which begins with a vowel is added to a word that ends in `q` or `k`, that final consonant changes to `ğ` and `y`, respectively. For example, `uşaq-ın-dır` → `uşağındır:is the child's`.

Note that _k_ may not change to _y_ if it is the end of the root of a verb. For example, in _Məndən əl çəkə bilərsən!_, we see it is _çəkə_, not _çəyə_, as one might expect.

**Based on final consonant of a verbal root**

If a verbal root ends in `t` and is followed by a suffix that begins with a vowel, the final consonant will change to `d`. Thus, `gedirəm:I'm going` (rather than `getirəm`). There are some exceptions to this, see EA, pg 86.

# Nouns

## Pronouns

### Personal

Number | NOM    | GEN   | LOC  | ACC  | DAT  | ABL
-------|--------|-------|------|------|------|-----
1s.    | mən    |mənim  | məndə|məni  | mənə | məndən
2s.    | sən    |sənin  | səndə|səni  | sənə | səndən
3s.    | o      |onun   | onda |onu   | ona  | ondan
1p.    | biz    |bizim  | bizdə|bizi  | bizə | bizsən
2p.    | siz    |sizin  | sizdə|sizi  | sizə | sizsən
3p.    | onlar  |onların  | onlardə|onları | onlara | onlardan

### Demonstrative

&nbsp; | near | far
-------|------|------
SG     | bu   | bunlar
PL     | o    | onlar

_Bu_ and _o_ also function as adjectives, in which case, they do not distinguish between singular and plural form, like all adjectives. Thus, <ex>_Bu kitablar maraqlıdır_ ⧸ These books are interesting.</ex> When used as a demonstrative pronoun, it is often fronted in the sentence and offset with a comma. For example, <ex>_O, yaxşı kitabdır_ ⧸ That is a good book.</ex><cite>[EoA, 29](#eoa)</cite>

## Cases

<attn>Case markings occur after suffixes, thus _Leyla şəkil-lər-də-dir_, Leyla is in the pictures.</attn>

∅
: nominative. The default case.

-(n)In
: genitive. Takes `n` as the buffer consonant, rather than the more common `y`. For example, `evindən:from her house`.

-(n)I or ∅
: accusative. The accusative is only marked when it is a definite object (e.g. "the apple" or "this apple") or a person, otherwise it is unmarked and is understood from context. So monosyllabic words, such as `nə:what` or `su:water` use _y_ as the joining consonant.

-(y)A
: dative. Indicates indirect object as well as movement towards a place.

-dA
: locative. Indicates location of an object or action, as well as time phrases related to seasons.

-dAn
: ablative. Indicates motion away from or out of an object or place. It has some additional uses as well. It can be used in comparative sentences and to mean "due to" or "because of". For example, <ex>_Onlar parka yağışdan getmədilər_ ⧸ We didn't go to the park because of the rain</ex>. It can also be used to indicate part of a whole, for example, <ex>_Bu köynəklərdən birni alıram_ ⧸ I am buying of these shorts</ex>.

# Suffixes

Azeri is an exclusively suffixing language when producing new words. 

-A
: to, towards, DAT.

-(y)An
: present partiple. _Wiktionary_ refers to this as the "subject non-past particple" and _Elementary Azerbaijani_ calls it the "present subject participle", however with the caveat that it can sometimes be used to express past actions.<cite>[EA, 239]</cite> It appears that the participle can only be used as the subject of the sentence.

-AndA
: verbal suffix meaning "when X is happening". For example, <ex>_Qış gələndə, soyuq olur_ ⧸ When winter comes, it becomes cold.</ex>. Since this suffix does not take a personal marker, speakers will often use the personal pronoun (which may normally be dropped) to indicate who is the actor in the `-AndA` clause.

-cA
: language of X. Note, cannot be used for countries that take -lI to form their adjective of nationality. It can be affixed to 1st and 2nd person pronouns to mean, "in my/your/our/y'alls opinion".

-çI
: one who does X.

-dIkcA
: the more one does X, the more Y. It is suffixed to the clause that expresses the "more one does" thought. For example, <ex>_İnsan böyüdükcə başa düşür ki..._ ⧸ The more a person grows up, the more they understand that...</ex>.

-lA
: with. See also "ilə" in postpositions.

-lAr
: plural, only used for animate things, plus some animals.

-lI
: adjectival suffix meaning "possessing X" or "characterized by X". This is used to create adjectives of nationality or birthplace, ex. `bakılı:one from Baku`.

-lIQ
: nominalizing suffix meaning "state of being X". Attached to adjectives, ex. `çətin:difficult` → `çətinlik:difficulty`.

-mAQ üçün (appended to a verb)
: in order to do the verb.

-mI
: question particle, not required, comes at the end of the sentence.

-nAn
: with. A colloquial version of `ilə`.

-pərvər
: a suffix derived from Persian, in most cases with a sense of "having X", though may have fossilized meanings now and is no longer a productive suffix. For example, `qonaq:guest` and `qonaqpərvər:hospitality`.

-sIz
: adjectival suffix meaning "without X" or "lacking X".

-şünas
: profession of.

-xana
: house of, ex. `çay:tea` → `çayxana:teahouse`.

--EX--
Siz haralısınız?
Where are you from? // using the nationality suffix -lI
Yemək üçün evə gəldim.
In order to eat, I came home.
Kitabı oxuyan uşaq mənim oǧlumdur.
The child who is reading the book is my son.
--ENDEX--

## Relative Suffix (-kI)

<attn>`-kI` can only be attached to nouns in LOC or GEN.<cite>[EoA, 105](#eoa)</cite></attn>

To form relative clauses, add `-kI` to the last word in the clause. For example, <ex>_Yazıçı kitabxanadakı kitabları yazdı_ ⧸ The author wrote the books which are in the library</ex>. `Kitabxanada:in the library` is the clause we want to relativize. Thus, adding `-kı` makes it "which are in the library" and putting it in front of the `kitabları:books.ACC` makes the relative phrase modify the word books. When attached to nouns in GEN, it functions much like the English phrasing "that which is".

# Prefixes

Azerbaijani prefixes are generally no longer productive.

na-
: "un-", from Persian.

qeyri-
: reverses meaning of following word. For example, `mümkün:possible` and `qeyri-mümkün:impossible`. A hypen is always used with this prefix.

# Postpositions

arasında
: between.

başqa (ABL)
: except for.

birlikdə
: together.

əlindən
: because of. Implies blame or fault.

gil
: the home of, "chez". Takes additional case and suffixes.

görə (NOM or DAT)
: for, due to (with DAT)

kimi (GEN)
: like, as soon as (with preceding verb in `+An`), till.

haqqında
: about.

ilə (GEN)
: with (both comitative and instrumental), by way of (with modes of transportation, except feet, that is `piyada:by foot`). Occasionally, when preceded by a word ending in a consonant, it will become the suffix `-lA`. This is most often used with people. For objects or "who", the LOC suffic `-dA` is used. Colloquially, this is often `-nAn`.

olaraq
: as a. The present participle of to be, "being".

sarı
: towards. Used in formal or poetic speech. Also means yellow.

tək
: like. May be seen attached to the word.<cite>[Simpson, p18](#simpson)</cite>

üçün (NOM or GEN)
: for, for the purpose of. Expresses intent when used with an infinitive.

--EX--
Mən Con gilə gedirəm.
I am going to John's house.
Sən ay kimisən.
You are like the moon.
Leyla bacısı ilə evə getdi.

# Verbs

<attn>Verbs appear at the end of clauses.</attn>

All verbs, with the exception of imək below is conjugated as follows.

1. Remove the -mAQ infinitive ending
2. Add the tense suffix
3. Add the personal suffix

For example, for the verb `bilmək:to know`:

1. bilmək → bil
2. bilIr → bilir
3. bilirAm → bilirəm

Colloquially, the personal suffix `-sInIz`, for the 2nd person plural is said as if it were `-sIz`, even if written in the full form. This is indicated below by parentheses around the `In` part, to indicate that it may be dropped.

## Tenses

### Present (PRS) -(y)Ir

Personal suffixes are very similar to "to be", differing only in 3rd person, where -dIr is not used.

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-Am  | -IQ
2|-sAn | -s(In)Iz
3|∅    | -(lAr)

The 2PL form is most often -sIz is spoken Azeri.

### Past (PST) -dI

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m   | -Q
2|-n   | -(nI)z
3|∅    | -(lAr)

### Imperative (IMP) -∅

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-Im  | -AQ
2|∅    | -AsIz
3|-sIn | -sInlAr

Outside of the basic imparative form, there are 3 words that can come before an IMP verb, that mean something similar to "let's" or "allow one".

* 1SG, 3SG, 3PL: `qoy`
* 2SG: `gəl`
* 1PL, 2PL: `gəlin`

`qoy` comes from `qoymaq:to let` and `gəl(in)` comes from `gəlmək:to come`. These words should be placed at the beginning of hte clause. <ex>_Gəlin parka gedək_ ⧸ Let's go to the park</ex>.

The 2PL form of an IMP verb can be used as a polite request.<cite>[EA, 59](#ea)</cite> Additionally, the INDEFFUT for 2sg/2pl can be used for an even more polite form. One may also hear `+A` at the end of the sentence as a softener.

### Future 

Azeri differentiates between two types of future tenses: defnitive and indefinite. The definite future tense "indicates that the action in question definitely will (or will not) occur."<cite>[EoA, 88](#eoa)</cite> Whereas the indefinite future tense is more ambiguous as to the likeliness of occurance.

#### Definitive Future (DEFFUT) -AcAQ

<attn>Since the tense marker ends in Q, there will be consonant assimilation. See the [Vowel Harmony and Consonant Assimilation](#vowel-harmony-and-consonant-assimilation) section above.</attn>

An example of the consonant assimilation can be seen in "I will go" and "I will read": `gət-` → `gədəcək-` → `gədəcəyəm`, `oxu-` → `oxuyacaq-` → `oxuyacağam`.

In colloquial speech, the `AQ` ending is dropped and instead the suffix is just `-Ac`.

&nbsp;  |SG |PL
-|------|--
1|-Am   | -IQ
2|-sAn  | -s(In)Iz
3|-(dIr)| -(lAr)

In 1SG, the suffix is often reduced to `-Ac` in casual speech.

--EX--
Mən söz verirəm ki qrupuda yazacam.
I promise I will write in the group chat.
--ENDEX--

#### Indefinite Future (INDEFFUT) -Ar

<attn>Since the suffix contains _r_, the negative is `-m` (like PRS). However, in negative for 2nd and 3rd person, the suffix becomes `-Az`. Thus, `görməzsən:you will not see`. Note that the stress does not change either. 🤷‍♀️</attn>

This form of the future has a sense of probability or possibility, but you're not totally sure it's going to happen. "The indefinite future tense can also express a regular or habitual activity. This meaning, however, is mostly reserved for proverbs and folk sayings."<cite>[EoA, 92](#eoa)</cite>

It is often used to form polite questions or ask permission. When asking permission, often the verb used is `olmaq:to happen` and the second verb is left in the infinitive. Otherwise, the verb is simply left in the INDEFFUT tense.

As might be expected, negating `olmaq:to happen` with an infinitive indicates that the action is impossible.

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-Am  | -IQ
2|-sAn | -s(In)Iz
3|∅    | -(lAr)

--EX--
Onların evinə getmək olar?
May I go to their house? // Asking permission with olmaq
Siz mənə qələm verərsiniz?
Can you give me a pen? // Polite question
O kitabı almaq olmaz.
Oxuya bilərsiz?
Can you (please) sing? // Polite request
It's impossible buy that book. // Impossibility
Adam, kişi olar!
Would a person become a man! // Often heard when asking someone to do a favor
--ENDEX--

### Future-in-the-Past (FUTPST)

Azeri has a tense that is referred to on Wikipedia as "future-in-the-past". It is used to talk about things that would have happened had the situation in the past been different. As a result, it is often paired with the past conditional. For example, "if you had studied it, you would be smart". "Studied" would be the past conditional ("if you had") and "would be" is the "future-in-the-past", since it is the speculative future result of a past action.

As with the standard future, the future-in-the-past is divided into definite and indefinite forms, which are formed by adding `-dI` to the future forms.

--EX--
Əgər sən onu oxusaydın, ağıllı olardin.
If you had studied, you would be smart.
--ENDEX--

#### Definite Future-in-the-Past (DEFFUTPST) -AcAQdI

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m | -Q
2|-n | -nIz
3|∅  | -(lAr)

#### Indefinite Future-in-the-Past (INDEFFUTPST) -ArdI

<attn>This follows the INDEFFUT for the negative, in that the `r` becomes `z`. Thus, the negative form is `-mAzdI`.</attn>

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m | -Q
2|-n | -(nI)z
3|∅  | -(lAr)

### Past Continuous (PSTCONT) -IrdI

<attn>This follows the INDEFFUT for the negative, in that the `r` becomes `z`. Thus, the negative form is `-mAzdI`.</attn>

When emphasizing the on-going nature of past actions.

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m | -Q
2|-n | -(nI)z
3|∅  | -(lAr)

### Present Perfect (PFT) -mIş/-Ib

<attn>The _ş_ is often dropped in the 2nd person in both spoken and written Azeri.<cite>[EoA, 112](#eoa)</cite></attn>

For completed actions that are relevent to the present, e.g. "I have seen it".

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-Am  | -IQ
2|-sAn | -s(In)Iz
3|∅    | -(lAr)

`-Ib` is a more colloquial form of the same ending. Indeed, some may give the following declensions, using `yığmaq:to collect`. Notice the 3rd person forms, using `-Ib`.

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|-----------
1| yığmışam | yığmışıq
2| yığmısan | yığmısız
3| yığıb    | yığıblar

### Past Perfect (PSTPFT) -mIşdI

For completed actions which finished in the past and happened before a second, more recent, contextual action.

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m   | -Q
2|-n   | -nIz
3|∅    | -(lAr)

### Conditionals (COND)

There are three ways of expressing the conditional in Azeri:

① other verb ending + personal ending + `-sA`
② `-sA` + personal ending
③ `-sAydI` + personal ending

Of the three, ① is the most common and the easiest, but all 3 forms are found. An example of ① is <ex>Əgər sən məktəbə gedirsənsə, bunu bilməlisən ⧸ If you're going to school, you must know this</ex>. Note that `-sA` is attached to the PRS form of the verb `getmək:to go`.

The use of the three forms can be found in the table below. It is divided by tense and by hypothetical/real situations. Broadly speaking, real situations will be type ① conditionals and hypothetical situations will vary based on the tense used.

&nbps; | Hypothetical | Real
-------|--------------|------------------
PRS    | ③ -sAydI    | ① -sA
PST    | ③ -sAydI    | ① -sA
FUT    | ② -sA       | ① -sA
PSTCONT| ① -sA       | ① -sA
FUTPST | ① -sA       | ① -sA

--EX--
Əgər sən yaxşi yəsən, tız böyüyərsən.
If you eat well, you will grow up quickly.
Əgər mən uça bilsəydim, mən hər yerə səyahət edərdim.
If I could fly, I would travel everywhere.
Əgər siz gələcəkdizsə, mənə niyə xəbər etmədiz?
If you were going to come, why didn't you inform me?
Əgər sən gəlməsən, mən səndən küsərəm.
If you don't come, I will be offended.
--ENDEX--

#### Non-Past (NPCOND) -sA

Any conditional that takes place not in the past, e.g. present or future. Often used in if-statements.

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m   | -Q
2|-n   | -z
3|∅    | -(lAr)

#### Past (PCOND) -sAydI

Any conditional that takes place in the past or the hypothetical present. Corresponds more or less to the English "had I done X, then Y would have happened".

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m   | -Q
2|-n   | -z
3|∅    | -(lAr)

### Optative (OPT) -A

Used to express wishes and desires. Wiktionary calls it the subjunctive and Speak Azeri calls it the "should" case. It is often found with `gərək:should` or `kaş:I wish`.<cite>[Speak Azeri](https://speakazeri.blogspot.com/2011/03/verb-chart-template-using-getmk.html)</cite> The negative form is `-mAyA`.<cite>[Simpson, p27](#simpson)</cite>

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-m   | -Q
2|-sAn | -sI(nI)z
3|∅    | -(lAr)


## imək (to be)

The only irregular verb in Azeri. Exists only as a suffix and is attached to the final word of a sentence in PRS. For example, <ex>_Mən professoram_ ⧸ I am a professor.</ex> `imək` is only used in PRS or PST. `olmaq`, a regular verb, is used in all other tenses.

As with all suffixes in Azeri, if a suffix is attached to a word ending in a vowel, a "buffer consonant"<cite>[EoA, 21](#eoa)</cite> `y` is added. Thus, `sürücü:driver` → `Mən sürücüyəm:I am a driver`.

<attn>The 'to be' suffix is not stressed.</attn>

### Present (PRS)

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|-Am  | -IQ
2|-sAn | -s(In)Iz
3|-dIr | -dIrlAr

In colloquial Azeri, the pronunciation varies somewhat. In particular, 2PL is pronounced as `-sIz`, 3SG as `-dI`, and 3PL as `-dIlAr`.<cite>[EA, 17](#ea)</cite>

**3rd Person Plural**<cite>[EoA, 24](#eoa)</cite>

The 3PL ending changes based on the subject in question:

* If the subject is a person it is `-dIrlAr` (with the plural suffix, `-lAr`)
* If the subject is an object it is simply `-dIr`
* If the subject is an animal, either above option works

### Past (PST)

In the past, "to be" functions as a standalone verb, following the regular past tense with a root of `i-`. `idi`, the 3SG form, can be paired with `var:there is` to mean `there were`.

&nbsp; |SG |PL
-|-----|--
1|idim | idik
2|idin | idiniz
3|idi  | idi(lər)

## Serial Verbs

In most cases, the subsequent verbs in a series of verbs (ex. to see in "I want to go to the movie") are placed before the declined verb. Thus, <ex>_Mən kinoya gətmək istəyirəm_ ⧸ I want to go to the movies</ex>.

As with all rules, there are exceptions. Two common verbs, `sevmək:to love` and `xoşlamaq:to like`, require the subsequent verbs, still in the infinitive, to be marked as if a direct object. That is, keep `-mAQ` and add `-I`. For example, <ex>_Mən oxumağı sevirəm_ ⧸ I like reading</ex>. Note that because the infinitive ends in _k_ or _q_ and will be followed by a vowel, consonant assimilation will occur.

`başlamaq:to start` functions similarly, but takes `-A` as the case marking of the verb. For example, <ex>_Ora biz gedən kimi, hər şəy yeməyə başlama!_ ⧸ Don't start eating everything as soon as we get there.</ex>

See also [Expressing Ability](#expressing-ability-a-bilmk-olarolmas) for those types of serial verb forms. 

## Modal Verbs

### Must -mAlI

`-mAlI` is suffixed to the verbal root and indicates that the action must be done. The person markers are the same as in PRS.

There are two nuances worth calling out: `-mAlI` with person markers and `-mAlI deyil` with person markers. Using `demək:to tell` to illustrate:

1. Dəməlisən – you musn't tell.
2. Dəməli deyilsən – you don't have to tell.

--EX--
Getməliyəm.
I must go.
--ENDEX--

### Should gərək

<attn>Do no use _gərək_ in questions. Use OPT or `-mAlI` instead.</attn>

`gərək` proceeds the verb, which is declined as follows.

&nbsp;  |SG |PL
-|------|--
1|-Im   | -AQ
2|-AsAn | -AsIz
3|-sIn  | -sInlAr

## Verbal Suffixes

These suffixes, when appended to the root of the verb, change the meaning from the base meaning of the root. In some cases, additional meanings have become associated with the suffixed form. For example, `yazmaq:to write` → `yazdırmaq:to register`, though `yazdırmaq` could be interpreted as "to make someone write".

-dIr
: to make someone do something, `içmək:to drink` → `içdirmək:to make someone drink`


-In
: reflexive verbal suffix, affixed to stem. Compare `döyür:he is knocking (on the door)` versus `döyürünür:(my heart) is beating`.

-Iş
: reciprical verbal suffix, affixed to stem. Indicates that the action is done between the subjects of the sentence. May have idiomatic meanings, too. Thus, `döyürük:we are knocking` versus `döyürüşük:we are fighting`, that is "knocking/hitting each other".

-lA
: "verbs the noun", so to speak. Takes a noun and makes it into a related verb, such as, `soyuq:cold` → `soyuqlamaq:to be cold`.

### Passive Voice

There are 5 ways to form the passive voice, based on the final letter of the verbal stem (i.e. without `-mAQ`).

If the stem ends in...

1. a consonant, except l: `-Il`, `göstərmək` → `göstərilmək:to be shown`
2. l or a vowel: `-(I)n`, `işləmək` → `işlənmək:to be used`
3. a vowel and is one of a few monosyllabic stems: `-yIl`, `demək` → `deyilmək:to be told`
4. an irregular formation: `-nIl`, `istəmək` → `istənilmək:to be wanted`
5. `-lA`: `-n(Il)`, `bağlamaq` → `bağlan(ıl)maq:to be closed`

The agent of the passive voice is marked with the postposition _tərəfindən_.

# Question Words

Question words are found at the end of the sentence, before the verb.

haçan
: when.

hansı
: which one.

hara
: where.

harada
: where at (where.LOC). Colloquially pronouced "harda".

haraya
: where to (where.DAT). Only used formally.

When contrasting two clauses (similar to English's _but_), `isə` is used. İsə "is the frozen conditional form of the auxiliary verb `i-` (to be)".<cite>[EA, 15](#ea)</cite> For example, <ex>_Mən müəlliməm, sən isə tələbəsən_ ⧸ I am a teacher, but you are a student.</ex> It occurs after the subject in the second clause. Contrast, if you will, with `bəs`, which contrasts between speakers, often after a question, such as in the common `bəs sən?:and you?`.

## There is... (var)

The verb `var` is placed at the end of the sentence, to indicate "there is/are...". To express the past tense (e.g. there were), var is paired `idi:was`.

--EX--
Universitetdə çoxlu tələbə var.
There are many students at the university.
İki kitab stolda var idi.
There were two books on the table.
--ENDEX--

## Expressing Need (lazım)

Need or necessity is expressed with the adjective _lazım_. The one needing something is in DAT and the thing needed is in NOM. Since it is an adjective, the verb for the sentence is "to be".

--EX--
Leylaya maşın lazımdır.
Leyla needs a car. // lit. A car is necessary to Leyla.
--ENDEX--

## Expressing Ability (-A bilmək, olar/olmas)

Expressing the ability to do something can be done in two diffrent ways.

The first is done with a special form of the verb. It is formed by removing the infinitive ending and appending `-(y)A`. This special form is paired with `bilmək:to know`. For example, <ex>_Mən görə bilirəm_ ⧸ I am able to see</ex>.

The second is with _olar_ for positive statements and _olmas_ for negative statements. The verb is left in the infinitive.

## Relative Conjunction (ki)

Similar to English's conjunction "that", _ki_ conjoins two sentences. It is required and is always followed by a comma. For example, <ex>_Mən sənə dedim ki, onlar evdə deyil_ ⧸ I told you that they are not home</ex>.

## Comparison

There are a few ways to compare things in Azeri.

**daha**

Indicates the comparative degree of an adjective, thus, `daha böyük:bigger`.

**ən**

Indicates the superlative degree of an adjective, thus, `ən böyük:the biggest`.

**Ablative case**

The ablative case is marked on the one that would follow "than" in English. For example, <ex>_Sevil Leyladan böyükdür_ ⧸ Sevil is bigger than Leyla</ex>. The noun in ABL may be follwed by `dA`.

## Possession

<attn>The possessive suffix (③ or ④) occurs before any case ending. In the 3rd person, when this occurs, a buffer consonant _n_ is always added.</attn>

Possession can be expressed in multiple ways.

① LOC + `var`
: The possessor takes LOC and the verb is `var`. This type of possession emphasizes the possessor<cite>[EoA, 47](#eoa)</cite> and is often temporary<cite>[EA, 80](#ea)</cite> or transitory (e.g. a mailcarrier with mail).

② GEN + to be 
: The possessor takes GEN and the verb is to be. The possessed object precedes the possessor.

③ GEN + POSS
: The possessor takes GEN and the possessed item takes the POSS case. If there are more than one noun doing the possessing, the last POSS marking agrees with the last noun. This is the most common form of indicating possession.<cite>[EoA, 78](#eoa)</cite>

The ③ form has these POSS suffixes:

&nbsp; | SG | pl
-|-----|-----
1|-(I)m|-(I)mIz
2|-(I)n|-(I)nIz
3|-(s)I|-(s)I

Since the only the 3rd person endings are ambiguous, a pronoun is only required for 3SG and 3PL. Otherwise, the GEN pronoun can be dropped.<cite>[EoA, p53]</cite>

For chained possession, ex. my friend's cat's encyclopedia, each object possessed must get a POSS suffix and each object possessing must get the GEN suffix. This means that some objects will have multiple suffixes. For example, <ex>_Universitet-in böyük kitabxana-sı-n-ın təzə kitablar-ı_ ⧸ The university's big libray's new books</ex>. How does this work?

1. First we have "university's big library", which is `universitet-in böyük kitabxana-sı`.
2. Then we have the "library's new books", which would be `kitabxana-nın təzə kitablar-ı`.
3. We put it all together, going left to right, meaning that before the library possesses anything, it is also possessed, so the GEN suffix attaches to the POSS suffix as seen above. Voila!

④ POSS + `var`
: Similar to ①, this emphasizes the object possessed.<cite>[EoA, 79](#eoa)</cite> In colloquial speech, in 1st or 2nd person, one may hear the POSS marker on `var`, rather than on the object. For example, <ex>_Varımdır_ ⧸ I have it</ex> or <ex>_Yoxumdur_ ⧸ I don't have it</ex>.<cite>[EA, 81](#ea)</cite>

⑤ POSS
: Just POSS is used in compound nouns, such as "radiator hat". The first part of the compound noun is unmarked and the second part is marked with POSS, e.g. `konsert bileti:concert ticket`. This becomes the noun itself, so case markings will append to the POSS marked noun (buffered with `-n-` if 3SG POSS), ex. `məktəb kitablarında:in the school books`.

--EX--
Məndə çoxlu kitab var.
I have a lot of books. // Type ① possession
Bu kitab Leylanındır.
This book is Leyla's. // Type ② possession
O sənin kitabındır.
That is your book. // Type ③ possession
Pulunuz varmı?
Do you have any money? //Type ④ possession
Onların evində kim var?
Who is at their house?
--ENDEX--

## Negation

<attn>Note that Azeri exhibits double negation, thus _heç nə görmürəm:I see nothing_.</attn>

There are three different ways of negating a sentence. 

**To Be sentences (deyil)**

When something _is not_ something, the word `deyil` is used. In spoken Azeri, it is often pronounced [dö:l].<cite>[EA, 20](#ea)</cite> The personal suffix is affixed to `deyil`.

**There is... (yoxdur / yox)**

`var` from existential sentences is replaced with `yoxdur` in the negative. In the past tense, it is `yox idi`.

Colloquially, you may hear _yox_ used with personal endings. For example, <ex>_Məndə feys yoxdur_ ⧸ I am not on Facebook</ex> versus <ex>_Mən feysdə yoxam_ ⧸ I am not on Facebook</ex>. Compare this with _Məndə deyiləm_. This sentence would mean something more like "I am not presently on Facebook (i.e. logged in)" versus using _yoxdur_ which implies that you don't have a Facebook account at all.

**Regular Verbs (-mA)**

The suffix -mA (or -m if `r` is in the following tense suffix, such as in the present tense) is inserted between the verbal root and the tense suffix. Thus, `Mən bilirəm:I know` → `Mən bilmirəm:I don't know`.

In IMP, where one would be tempted to look for a word meaning "don't", as in "don't do this", the negative marker suffices.

--EX--
Mən həkim deyiləm.
I am not a doctor. // Notice that the 'to be' ending is attached to _deyil_
Universitetdə çoxlu tələbə yoxdur.
There aren't many students at the university.
Fəridə dünən məktəbdə deyil idi.
Fəridə wasn't at school yesterday.
Kitabxanada tələbələr yox idi.
There were no students in the library.
--ENDEX--

## The three uses of da/də

`dA` can be used in a variety of ways, even all three within one sentence. The vowel in `dA` changes based on the immediately preceding vowel.

1. Adds emphasis when following a verb. It's often to heighten the emotion of the sentence, such as emphasizing "on" in "come on".
2. Equivalent to "also", following the word which is "also" had
3. A conjunction, "even though" or "despite the fact". The clause preceding `dA` is the "even though X" clause and is either in the past or non-past conditional tense.

--EX--
Mənim qələmim olsa da, yaza bilmirəm.
Even though I have a pen, I cannot write.
Mənim də ailəm var.
I also have a family. // Note that _də_ is following _mənim_, as it '_I_ also have a family', rather than 'I have a family _also_'.
--ENDEX--

## In order to

There are two ways to express "in order to". We can see this using the example sentence "in order to be strong, you must do sports".

① Using `üçün:for`, place the "in order to" clause in the first half of the sentence. <ex>_Gülcü olmaq üçün, sən idman etməlisən._ ⧸ In order to be strong, you must do sports.</ex>

② Using [ki](#ki), place the "in order to" clause after _ki_ in the [Optative](#optative). <ex>_Sən idman etməlisən ki, güclü olasan._ ⧸ You must do sports, in order to be strong.</ex>

## Emphatic Expressions

In music or poetry, and occasionally in spoken language, emphatic "I/you/we/etc. are" statements can be made by attaching the copula to the personal pronoun, followed by the adjective. For example, <ex>_Sənsən qəşəng_ ⧸ YOU are pretty</ex>, as opposed to a neutral statement like _Sən qəşəngdir_. Other pronouns can be used, each taking their specific ending.

## Direct and Indirect Speech (demək ki)

Direct speech is offset with quotes and followed by a conjugated form of `demək:to say`. Thus, <ex>_Mən ona "sağa dön" dedim_ ⧸ I said to him "turn to the right".</ex>

Compare with marking indirect speech, where `ki` is used: <ex>_Mən ona dedim ki, sağa dönsün_ ⧸ I said to him that he must turn to the right</ex>. This second example is a bit hard to translate, as _-sin_ here is the 3rd person imperative marker.

# Adverbs

Adverbs can often be formed by dropping the infinitive marker (`-mAQ`), adding `-A` and duplicating the word. For instance, `baxa-baxa:watchingly` (from `baxmaq:to watch`) or `gülə-gülə:laughingly` (from `gülmək:to laugh`).

In other cases, it may be a noun followed by `səkildə:in the image`. This indicates perhaps more literally "in the image of X", but is used much as English adds `-ly` to the ends of adjectives. For example, `həvəskar:amature` → `həvəskar şəkildə:amaturishly`.

# Participles

Participles are often equivalent to English relative clauses (which/who does X).

## Non-Future (-dIQ-)

Non-future here means past or present. These participles are often used as relative clauses, such as "that which I am reading". It formed by appending `-dIQ` after the verb root (and negative marker) and before the POSS marker.<cite>[EA, 212](#ea)</cite> The object of the relative clause will be marked with GEN.

Since the suffix ends in `Q`, there will be consonant changes. For example, `oxu-duğ-ım:that which I am reading`. Or a more full example, <ex>_oxuduğun məktub_ ⧸ the letter which you read/are reading</ex>.

--EX--
Nazimin oxuduğu kitab maraqlı idi.
The book that Nazim read was interesting.
Dünən baxa bilmadiyim kinoya bugün baxdım.
The film that I couldn't see yesterday, I watched today.
--ENDEX--

## Non-Past (-An)

It is formed by appending `-An` to the verb root and corresponds roughly with the English gerund, ex. "to write" → "writing". Thus, `yazmaq:to write` → `yazan:(who is) writing`.  "The head noun in a participle phrase comes at the end and all words modifying this noun procede it."<cite>[EA, 246](#ea)</cite> Compare `gələn qonaq:the guest who is coming` and `qonaq gələn:she is coming as a guest` (`qonaq gəlmək:to come as a guest`). Sometimes the head noun is omitted and the participle functions as the noun. For example, <ex>_mənə məktub yazanı tanımıram_ ⧸ I don't know (the person) who wrote the letter to me</ex>.

--EX--
Amərikadan gələn qonaq...
The guest who is coming from America...
--ENDEX--

# Numbers

## Cardinal Numbers

<attn>When a number is used, the following noun does not need to be in the plural.</attn>

0 - sıfır
1 - bir
2 - iki
3 - üç
4 - dörd
5 - beş
6 - altı
7 - yeddi
8 - səkkiz
9 - doqquz
10 - on

Numbers 11-19 are formed as `on + {number 1-9}`. Additional higher order numbers are formed the same way, with special words for 10s, 100, 1000, and 1000000.

20 - iyirmi
30 - otuz
40 - qırx
50 - əlli
60 - altmış
70 - yetmiş
80 - səksən or həştad
90 - doxsan
100 - yüz
1000 - min
1000000 - milyon

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal number are formed with the suffix `-(I)ncI`. For numbers above 10, such as 15, only the final number takes the suffix. Thus, `on beşinci:15th`. The abbreviation is the last two letters of the suffix: 15-ci or 4-cü.

1st - birinci
2nd - ikinci
3rd - üçüncü
4th - dördüncü
5th - beşinci
6th - altıncı
7th - yeddinci
8th - səkkizinci
9th - doqquzuncu
10th - onuncu

# Time

## Time Vocabulary

There are two sets for names of the week. In formal Azeri, there are specific names:

Monday - bazar ertəsi
Tuesday - çərşənbə axşamı
Wednesday - çərşənbə
Thursday - cümə axşamı
Friday - cümə
Saturday - şənbə
Sunday - bazar

In colloquial Azeri, though, starting with Monday, they are simply spoken as `birinci gün:1st day`, etc. If something takes place on a day, the phrase is treated as a [compound noun (see ⑤)](possession). This means that for forms already said as a compound noun: bazar ertəsi, çərşənbə axşamı, and cümə axşamı, no change is needed. For the other days, the day of the week will be followed by `günü`. Thus, `cümə günü:on Friday`.

Months are listed below. 

January - yanvar
February - fevral
March - mart
April - aprel
May - may
June - iyun
July - iyul
August - avqust
September - sentyabr
October - oktyaber
November - noyabr
December - dekabr

## Time Expressions

The year in which something occurs is expressed as an ordinal number. The month in which something occurs is expressed with LOC. If it is a month + year combo, then GEN/POSS is used, which the year marked in GEN and the month marked in POSS, as well as LOC. Similarly, if it is a month + day combo, the month is marked with GEN, the day (in cardinal form) with POSS and LOC.

Similar to [Georgian](/r/learns/georgian#time-expressions), the first hour of the day is 12. Thus, all time expressions are one off from English. That is, 12:30 would be "1's thirty", or _birin yarısı_. Other minutes use either `işləyib:past` or `qalıb:til`. These are paired with the hour in DAT. No additional verb is needed, as _işleyib_ and _qalıb_ are verbal forms. For example, <ex>_Birə beş dəqiqə işleyib_ ⧸ It is 12:05</ex>.

Since `saat:hour,o'clock` is a versatile word, be careful with ordering when paird with `neçə:how many`. Thus, `saat neçədir:what time is it?` versus `neçə saat:how many hours (is it)?`. When in the form `saatliq`, it means "for x number of hours", thus `2 saatliq:for two hours`.

--EX--
Mən Bakıya 2003-cü ildə getdim.
I went to Baku in 2003. // lit. the 2003rd year.
Doqquza iyirmi beş dəqiqə qalıb.
It is 8:35.
--ENDEX--

# Miscellaneous

## Pronunciation Notes

It words where _y_ becomes _ğ_, but is shortly followed by _q_, such as in `alacağıq:we will get`, the _ğ_ is pronounched as _y_. It is still written with _ğ_ though!

Most words are stressed on the last syllable, but some words are not. For example, `sàbah:tomorrow`, versus `sabàh:morning`, where the accent indicates the stressed syllable. 

Make sure to pay attention to this, as well as when vowels are lengthened in speech (which is unmarked in writing).

### Dialetical Notes

Baku
: ilə may become _-nə_, such as `bizimnə:with us`.
