# Vowel Harmony

front vowels i ü e ö ə
back vowels u ı o a

based on final vowel in a word

a vs. ə based on front/back
i vs ı vs u vs ü based on front/back, rounded/unrounded
k (front) vs q (back)

thus `qələm:pen` -> `qələmlər:pens` or `kitab:book` -> `kitablar:books`.

Azeri exhibits both consonant assimilation and vowel harmony. Meaning that some consonants in suffixes will change quality depending on the last letter of the root word. Similarly, some vowels will change based on quality of vowels in the root (such as ə to a). This is illustrated below by representing the letters that experience consonant assimilation or vowel harmony as capitals. For example, _+??_ will different for both the consonant and vowel depending on what it is attached to.

# Nouns

Plurals are formed with the suffix -lər.

# Verbs

## imek (to be)

The only irregular verb in Azeri. Exists only as a suffix and is attached to the final word of a sentence. For example, <ex>_Mən professoram_ ⧸ I am a professor.</ex>

As with all suffixes in Azeri, if a suffix is attached to a word ending in a vowel, a "buffer consonant"<cite>[EoA p21](#eoa)</cite> `y` is added. Thus, `sürücü:driver` → `Mən sürücüyəm:I am a driver`.

<attn>The 'to be' suffix is not stressed.</attn>

2|-sAn | -sInIz
3|-dIr | -dIr(lAr)

**3rd Person Plural**<cite>[EoA p24](#eoa)</cite>

The 3pl ending changes based on the subject in question:

* If the subject is a person it is `-dIrlAr` (with the plural suffix, `-lAr`)
* If the subject is an object it is simply `-dIr`
* If the subject is an animal, either above option works
