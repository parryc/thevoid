## Numbers

> Because traditional Noongar society was a non-monetary system, _waangkaniny_ did not count beyond three. You will notice in the table below that after _dambart_ (three) is the word _boola_ (many). People would generally refer to amounts after three as _'boola boola'_ – adding on more of the word _'boola'_ to indicate many many!
> The revival of the Noongar _waangankiny_ now incorporates the counting of more numbers. This is based on the numbers 1-3, and then adding the word _maar_ which means 'hand' or in the counting context, 5 as in 5 fingers.
