# An Introductory Note

As with many under resourced (and often indigenous) languages, resources may unintentionally record a specific dialect. Similarly, when learning from a teacher, they will speak in their own dialect, as there is rarely a "standardized" way of speaking. The teacher I've mostly learned from is from near Mérida, the capital of the state of Yucatán – but there are speakers further eastward across the entire peninsula. All this to say, if you have found this page since you are learning as well, hopefully my notes align with what you're hearing – and if they don't, it might be dialect!

# Nouns

There is no grammatical gender in Yucatec Maya.

## Plurality

Plurality can be marked with the suffix _(o)'ob_. When the noun ends in a vowel, the first _o_ is dropped. For example, `mesa'ob:tables`. Otherwise, it is suffixed to the end, `paalo'ob:children`.

## Personal Pronouns

In Mayanist literature, there are two types of pronouns: Set A and Set B. You are unlikely to hear them referred to as such by a native speaker, even one with grammatical training. You may hear Set A described as "dependent pronouns" (as they are dependent on being used as part of a phrase) and you may hear Set B described as "suffixes" (as they are suffixed to a verb stem). I am not a Mayanist, so I will be using the terms _Dependent Pronouns_ and _Suffixal Pronouns_, amongst other terms, which will be made clear in their respective sections.

### Dependent Pronouns

Dependent pronouns mark:

* SUBJ of transitive verbs
* SUBJ of imperfective intransitive verbs
* Possession (POSS)

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|in|(e)k, ∅, k {verb}-e'ex
2|a|a {verb}-e'ex
3|u|u {verb}-o'ob

Where `{verb}` is used, this indicated that there will _also_ be a suffix to the verb when the dependent pronoun is required. Additionally, some notes about 1PL. In Yucatán, _k_ is the preferred form. When the aspect marker (as discussed below) is _k_, in casual speech, the dependent pronoun is dropped (rather than _k k_). In careful speech, it is realized as _ek_ and thus (_k ek_). The suffixed form, _k {verb}-e'ex_ is said to be used in the eastern part of the peninsula. Both [Hofling](#hofling) and [Andrade](#andrade) refer to the suffixal form as being an exclusive 1PL (as in, we but not you).

When the noun following the dependent pronoun begins with a vowel, there is a "harmony" letter that is prefixed to it. In the case of 1st person or 2nd person, it is _w-_ (ex. `otoch:house` – `in wotoch:my house`) and for 3rd person, it is a _y-_ (`u yotoch:his or her house`). The preceding _w_ or _y_ may be dropped in the case where it may be confused with a more common noun or phrase. For example, _w_ may not be used with `áanalte':book`, in order to disambiguate it from `áanal:below`. Thus, _a áanalte'o'_ rather than _a wáanalte'o'_.

An alternative eastern POSS form is `k {verb}-o'on`, such as `k paalo'on:our child`.

How to use these pronouns can be found in the more detailed sections below:

* [Possession](#possession)
* [Verbs](#verbs)

### Suffixal Pronouns

Suffixal pronouns mark:

* Direct object of a transitive verb
* SUBJ of perfective and dependent intransitive verbs
* Simple sentences with adjectives and nouns (he is, you are, etc.) Or put another way, "stative SUBJ with adjectives and nouns"<cite>[Hoffling, pg 692](#hofling)</cite>

These are appended to the noun that the subject is. Thus, <ex>_Parryen_ ⧸ I am Parry</ex>.

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|-en|-o'on
2|-ech|-e'ex
3|∅|-o'ob

Note that these are much the same as the independent pronouns below, minus the consonants at the beginning (or _leti'_ in the case of 3SG/3PL).

## Independent Pronouns

Independent pronouns answer the question "who", provide emphasis of the person (e.g. "you yourself"), and function as indirect pronouns (preceded by `ti':to`).

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|teen|to'on
2|teech|te'ex
3|leti'|leti'ob

## Articles

There are no articles in Yucatec Maya. The definite article is assumed and the indefinite article can be considered the same as the demonstratives, described below.

## Demonstratives

All demonstratives are preceded by _le_ and the noun (or phrasal noun) is suffixed with either _a'_, _o'_, or _e'_ to indicate the nearness to the speaker. Prior to the suffix just listed, there may be a plurality suffix _(o)'ob_, as well as a dependent pronoun, to indicate possession.

As worked example:

{le in chambaalo'oba':these are my babies}
demonstrative marker|POSS|noun|PL suffix|nearness
**le**|**in**|**chambaal**|**o'ob**|**a'**
∅|1SG.POSS|baby|PL|this
{/}

The nearness suffixes are as follows:

* _-a'_: near, this
* _-o'_: far, that
* _-e'_: over there, not physically present

An example without any optional items:

{le úuricha':this snail}
demonstrative marker|noun|nearness
**le**|**úurich**|**a'**
∅|snail|this
{/}

## Suffixes

il
: when used dependent pronouns, means "to be from somewhere", ex. <ex>_Yucatanilen_ ⧸ I am from Yucatan</ex>. See also [Something of Something possession](#something-of-something) below.

## Body Parts

Many body parts are logical conjunctions of other body parts. For example, `kaal:neck` + `k'ab:hand` gives _u kaal k'ab_ – what is the "neck of the hand"? The wrist!

Some additional examples below, in a general form. To grant possession, _-il_ is still required (as seen below in the [section on posession](#Possession). Thus, <ex>_u kaalil in k'ab_ ⧸ my wrist</ex>.

- u kaal k'ab: wrist
- u kaal ook: ankle
- u yich ook: the ankle bone
- u yaal k'ab: fingers
- u neek' ich: pupil

_Ich_ normally means "eye", but as you can see above, when used with another body part, it means the "protrusion of X", often referring to bones.

_Aal_ is a variant of `paal:child`, normally used by women to jokingly(?) refer to their child, since _aal_ also means "weight" or "heavy" (i.e. the burden of pregnancy and/or motherhood).

# Verbs

<attn>Note: many of the examples below are taken from [Briceño Chel's](#briceño-chel) book on Yucatec Maya verbs. They predominantly use `janal:to eat`.</attn>

## Copular Sentences

There is no copula in Yucatec Maya, but one still needs to express simple sentences such as "I am X". This is done with the suffixal pronoun attached to the thing that you/he/she is. For modifying copular sentences with different aspects, see [Verbalized Adjectives](#verbalized-adjectives) below.

--EX--
Jach wi'ijen.
I am very hungry.
--ENDEX--

## Intransitive Verbs

Intransitive verbs are verbs with an actor (i.e. the person doing the verb-ing) and no object upon which they are doing an action. In English, that might be "I eat", which has no object, versus "I eat pasta", which does.

Intransitive verbs, barring the special forms below, use the dependent pronoun. The dependent pronoun is either combined with the aspectual marker listed below, or used standalone. When the aspect marker below is followed by a `-`, it means that the aspect marker is prefixed to the dependent pronoun. Some markers also have `-e'`, which is suffixed to the verb. In the case where a verb begins with a vowel, the appropriate w/y consonant is prefixed to the verb (_kin wok'ol_).

Habitual/Indefinite Present (_k-_)
: Common actions with no explicit temporality. <ex>_Kin janal_ ⧸ I eat</ex>.

Progressive Present (_t(áan)_)
: Action is occurring as the speaker is saying it. Some speakers will drop _áan_ and append the dependent pronoun to _t_. Thus, _tin_ versus _táan in_. <ex>_Tin janal_ ⧸ I am eating</ex>.

Compulsive Present (_yaan_)
: Mandatory actions. <ex>_Yaan in janal_ ⧸ I must eat</ex>.

Terminative Perfective (_ts'(o'ok)_)
: Finished actions that are not yet considered "past" actions, i.e. still exist within the present context. This is referred to in Andrade, §2.12, as a perfective form. These actions occur further in the past that the immediate perfective below. Some spekers will drop _o'ok_ and append the dependent pronoun to _ts'_. Thus, _ts'in_ versus _ts'o'ok in_. <ex>_Ts'in janal_ ⧸ I (already) ate</ex>.

Immediate Perfective (_táant -e'_)
: Actions that have just completed. These actions occur closer to the present than the terminative, above. <ex>_Táant in janale'_ ⧸ I just ate</ex>.

Assurative Future (_je'(el) -e'_)
: Implies that the action will be carried out in the future. Since the abbreviated form, _je'_ ends in a glottal stop, there is no need to suffix the dependent pronoun to it and is not normally done so. <ex>_Je' in janale'_ ⧸ I must eat</ex>.

Immediate Future (_n- -ka'aj_)
: Actions that will be carried out in the future. Note that for 1SG, the _n_ in _in_ is dropped. <ex>_Nika'aj janal_ ⧸ I will eat</ex>.

Emphatic Immediate Future (_k- -n_)
: Actions that will be carried out in the future. This form, compared to the immediate future above, places an emphasis on the actor carrying on the action. Note that for 1SG, the _n_ in _in_ is dropped. <ex>_Kin janal_ ⧸ It is _I_ who will eat</ex>.


### Special Forms

There are two special forms for intransitive verbs. These forms do not apply to verbs of motion, stative verbs, or verbalized adjectivs.<cite>[Briceño Chel, p24](#briceño-chel)</cite>

Both forms are infixed between the verb and the suffixal pronoun.

Completetive (_-naj-_)
: Used for totally completed actions in the past. For example, with `janal:to eat`, <ex>_Janalnajen_ ⧸ I ate.</ex>

Indefinite Future (_bíin -nak-_)
: Also known as the "prophetic future", it is used for distant, uncertain future events. Again, with `janal:to eat`, <ex>_Bíin janalnaken_ ⧸ One day, I will eat.</ex>

## Verbalized Adjectives

Similar to languages such as Chinese, adjectives can become verbs, which often change their meaning from "I am (adjective)" to "I acting in an (adjective) way", replete with the aspectual variations, such as "I was (adjective). Thought of another way, because there is no copula, one must conjugate the adjective, in lieu of conjugating the copula.

Verbalized adjectives, in addition to the suffix indicated aspect, use the suffixal pronouns.

Completetive (_-chaj_)
: Indicates that the speaker has completely become the adjective, in the past. Using the above, `xáan:slow`, <ex>_xáanchajen_ ⧸ I was late</ex>, or literally "I was slow".

# Possession

Possession is a structurally complex topic (see, _Possession in Yucatec Maya_ by Christian Lehmann, 2003) and so this section may have a few overlapping subsections.

## Simple Possession

Simple possession is for saying "my brother". They use the dependent pronouns, above. For example, "my brother" would be _in suku'un_.

{in suku'un:my brother}
dependent pronoun|noun
**in**|**suku'un**
1SG.POSS|brother
{/}

### With Classifiers

Like many languages, nouns can be classified into groups. However, with Yucatec Maya, this is only applied to possession – that is, only when someone possesses the noun, does one need to classify it, if the classification of the noun is not obvious or could otherwise have a different interpretation. For example, in the abstract _in peek'_ could mean either "my dog" or "my hot dog". To clarify which is meant, a speaker would use a possessive classifier. Thus, "my hot dog" would be _in wo'och peek'_ and "my (domesticated) dog" would be _in walak' peek'_, where `o'och:food.CL` and `alak':domesticated animal.CL` are the base forms and add the harmony _-w_ mentioned under [Dependent Pronouns](#dependent-pronouns).

{in walak' peek':my dog}
dependent pronoun|harmony marker|classifier|noun
**in**|**w**|**alak'**|**peek'**
1SG.POSS|∅|domesticated.CL|dog
{/}

Lehmann, §3.2.2.2.3.1.3.2, mentions that the set of classifiers is open and (at least as of 2003 and what I've been able to find online), there is no exhaustive treatment of them. Modified from Lehmann T19, a list of classifiers is found below.

meaning | CL    
--------|-------
food    | o'och 
domesticated animal | alak'
something grown | pak'al
something made | mejen
something received | matan
something presented | sij
something bought | man
something sold | kon
something cut | ch'ak
something drawn/hauled | pay
something fetched | ch'a'
something pulled | kóol

## Something of Something

In other languages, this might be called genitive possession, e.g. the door of the school or the book of the teacher. However, as there is no GEN in Yucatec Maya, it is something different. Andrade touches on this in §4.60.3.

The basic structure is as follows _u {possessed}il {possessor}_. For example, <ex>_u najil xook_ ⧸ the school</ex> or more literally "the building of studying". When more than one "possessed" is needed, they are all modified with the _u -il_ form. For example, "the market of the school" would be _u najil u koonolil u najil xook_, where `u najil koonol:market` is the base form. You can see that `koonol:selling` gets modified by _u -il_.

In the case of plurals, the plural suffix, _-o'ob_ comes after _-il_: `u meyajilo'ob janal:the chores for food`. In the case of personal possession, the personal POSS pronoun comes before the last noun: `u najil in xook:my school`.

## Inalienable Possession

Possession of something that is "inalienable", i.e. something that is intrinsically part of the possessor, such as an organ, uses _-el_, rather than _-il_.

Examples of inalienable objects:

- bak': flesh
- baak: bone
- ts'o'ots: hair
- k'i'ik': blood
- ts'o'om: marrow

--EX--
u ts'o'omel u pool
his brain
Yaj in xiich'el.
My muscles hurt.
Uts tin chi' u bak'el k'éenk'en.
I like (to eat) pork. // lit. the flesh of a pig
--ENDEX--

# Adjectives

Adjectives come before the noun, ex. <ex>_le chak abala' jats'uts_ ⧸ this red plum is beautiful</ex>, where `chak:red` comes before `abal:plum`. To make a copular sentence (i.e "is") with an adjective, it comes after the noun: <ex>_abale' chak_ ⧸ the plum is red</ex>.

Adjectives can be made intense by reduplication: `k'an:yellow` → `k'ank'an:very yellow`.

## Plurality

The standard way of pluralizing adjectives is with the suffix _-o'ob_, just like nouns. Thus, <ex>_In suku'uno'ob jach ki'ichkelemo'ob._ ⧸ My older brothers are handsome.</ex>

However, some adjectives are used only with plural nouns and some only with singular nouns.

- big: nojoch (SG), nukuch (PL)
- small: (chi)chan (SG), mejen (PL)

When an adjective is used with _-il_ (see below), it uses the plural form of the adjective.

## Adjectives with -il

Adjectives can be suffixed with _-il_ to indicate a "selective quality", which could be loosely translated as "of all" the nouns in the current speaking context, this is the "adjective" one. For example, <ex>_u chakil abal jats'uts_ ⧸ (of all the plums) the _red_ plum is beautiful</ex>. It is not clear at present if this also indicates superlative nature (e.g it is reddest), or if it is just emphatic.

## Colors

There are 6 primary colors from which all other colors are derived.

- boox: black
- k'an: yellow
- chak: red
- ya'ax: green
- ch'ooj: blue
- sak: white

Some example combinations:

- sakboox: grey (white + black)
- chakch'ooj: purple (red + blue)
- chakk'an: orange (red + yellow)

There are 2 semi-primary colors that do not create additional colors:

- chakwa', which is also the word for chocolate, and is used for brown
- chúukin, which is also the word for coal, and is used for grey

# Prepositions

ti'
: sort of a generic preposition, corresponding to at, to, for, by, in, (de, en, a in Spanish)

# Sentence Structures

## Questions

- ba'axten: why
- bix: how
- jay: how many, how much – requires a numeric classifer
- kux: and (as a rejoinder), e.g. `kux teech?:and you?`
- máax: who
- tu'ux: where

--EX--
Jayp'éel ja'ab yaan teech?
How old are you?
--ENDEX--

## Negation

- ma': no
- mixba'al: nothing
- mixtu'ux: nowhere
- mina'an: there is nothing / I have nothing, etc.

Simple negation with _ma'_ requires the _-i'_ sentence/clausal suffix on the last word being negated, unless there is already a suffix on the word.

For example: _Ma' ke'elen_ doesn't have _-i'_ because `ke'el:cold` already has the suffixal pronoun `-en:1SG`. _Ma' ke'eli'_ does require the _-i'_ suffix, since there is no other suffix on _ke'el_. This is only applicable to very simple sentences. In the case of longer sentences, where the negation is only a single clause in the sentence, _-i'_ would be required, regardless. You can see that in the beginning of the sentence _Ma' wi'ijeni' táan in janal le ka'aj luk'en tin wotoche'_.

--EX--
Ma' wi'ijeni' ts'o'ok in janal.
I'm not hungry, I finished eating.
--ENDEX--

## Clausal Suffixes

e'
: Clausal terminator. It is affixed to the last word in a clause to indicate that it is complete. <ex>_In na'e' ki'ichpam_ ⧸ My mom is pretty</ex>.

i'
: Sentence terminator. Andrade (§3.7) notes that sentences almost invariably end with `-i'` when the final "construction" of the stentence requires a suffixal pronoun. This will dominate other suffixal particles – i.e. in cases where there could be multiple, _-i'_ will be used.

## Common Structures

### Ability to do something

Ability is indicated with _oojel_ plus the verb. Thus, <ex>_In woojel paax_ ⧸ I can play an instrument</ex><cite>[Jorge et al., s6e12](#jorge)</cite>, where `paax:to play an instrument` is the verb one is able to do. Note that because the dependent pronoun is used, _oojel_ is prefixed with w/y.

### To Like Something

Liking something requires indicating _how_ one likes it. That is, what sense is used to enjoy the thing.

There are 4 senses used, plus a generic catch-all for everything else:

- xikin (ear): aurally
- chi' (mouth): taste (specifically of food)
- ni' (nose): olfactorly
- ich (eye): visibly
- t'aan: everything else

The general structure is:

{uts tin chi' tamales:I like tamales}
uts|to + dependent pronoun|classifier|what you like
**uts**|**tin**|**chi'**|**tamales**
good|to-{1SG}|food.CL|tamales
{/}

You may also hear, for _chi'_ and _xikin_, the use of `ki':rich` (as in "rich food") instead of _uts_.

--EX--
Uts tin t'aan in kanik maaya.
I like to study (Yucatec) Mayan.
Uts tin ni' a ki'ibok.
I like your perfume. // Via smell
--ENDEX--

# Numbers

## Numbers

Yucatec Maya is a vigesimal (base 20) language. Mayan numerals are in parentheses, they are most often written vertically, with the 1s place at the bottom.

0: juub (<span class="maya">𝋠</span>)
1: jun (<span class="maya">𝋡</span>)
2: ka' (<span class="maya">𝋢</span>)
3: óos (<span class="maya">𝋣</span>)
4: kan (<span class="maya">𝋤</span>)
5: jo' (<span class="maya">𝋥</span>)
6: wak (<span class="maya">𝋦</span>)
7: uk (<span class="maya">𝋧</span>)
8: waxak (<span class="maya">𝋨</span>)
9: bolon (<span class="maya">𝋩</span>)
10: lajun (<span class="maya">𝋪</span>)

In addition to the teens having the standard "ones + _lajun_" form below, 11 and 12 each have additional forms that one may hear. Note that when appending `lajun:ten`, if the number ends in a vowel, that vowel is repeated with a `'`.

11: junlajun / balak' (<span class="maya">𝋫</span>)
12: ka'alajun / lajka'aj (<span class="maya">𝋬</span>)
13: óoxlajun (<span class="maya">𝋭</span>)
14: kanlajun (<span class="maya">𝋮</span>)
15: jo'olajun (<span class="maya">𝋯</span>)
16: waklajun (<span class="maya">𝋰</span>)
17: uklajun (<span class="maya">𝋱</span>)
18: waxaklajun (<span class="maya">𝋲</span>)
19: bolonlajun (<span class="maya">𝋳</span>)

Similar to other Mayan languages, the work for 20 comes from the word for person _ma'ak_, indicating the origin of the system: all of one's fingers and toes.

20: junk'aal (<span class="maya">𝋡𝋠</span>)
400: baak' (<span class="maya">𝋡𝋠𝋠</span>)
8,000: p'íik (<span class="maya">𝋡𝋠𝋠𝋠</span>)

Numbers are combined with _tu_. Thus, 53 is _óoxlajun tu ka'ak'aal_ (13 and 2 x 20).

Of the symbols themselves, <span class="maya">𝋡</span> are called _ch'aaj_ and <span class="maya">𝋥</span> are called either _jarat'_ or _jilib_. _Juub_ (<span class="maya">𝋠</span>) is the name for zero and the symbol.

## Numeric Classifiers

All numbers require a classifier. The three most common classifiers are:

- p'éel: any non-living object, such as shoes
- túul: people or animals
- kúul: plants

These classifiers are suffixed to the number.

--EX--
Tin wotoche' waxaktúulo'on.
In our house, there are 8 (of us).
Tin wotoche' yaan óoxp'éel naj.
In our house there are 3 buildings. // "house" here being used to mean complex where one lives, usually consisting of a bathroom, a kitchen, and a sleeping area.
