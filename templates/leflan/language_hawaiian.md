# Articles and Determiners (Kaʻi)

## Articles

he
: a/an

ka/ke
: the. One general rule for determining if _ka_ or _ke_ is used is by the word `ke ao:the cloud`. Words beginning with _k_, _e_, _a_, or _o_ will most often pair with _ke_. There are some exceptions, such as `ke ʻeke:the bag`, which begins with an ʻokina, but is paired with _ke_.<cite>[KLʻO ep1](#ʻōiwi)</cite>

kekahi
: another.<cite>[ʻŌO 0603V](#ʻōlelo)</cite>

ʻo
: vocative marker, proceeds a person or a place.

## Determiners

There are three determiners in Hawaiian.<cite>[ʻŌO 0608V](#ʻōlelo)</cite> These are used in the pepeke ʻAike He, below.

1. kēia - this
2. kēlā - that far from me/us
3. kēnā - that near to you


# Pepeke (Sentence Structures)

Pepeke are different sentence structures found in Hawaiian. Rather than try to match the structure with broader linguistic terms, they are taught in relations to the parts of a`heʻe:octopus`.<cite>[ʻŌO 0800V](#ʻōlelo)</cite>

Thus, a pepeke has 3 parts: `poʻo:head`, `piko:center`, and `ʻawe:tentacles`. Each sentence structure below serves a different purpose and fits different parts of speech into each part of the pepeke.

## Pepeke Painu (Descriptive Sentences)

This form is used for simple "X is Y" sentences. 

{structure}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
descriptor|subject|∅
{/}

For example, _the poi is delicious_.

{ʻono ka poi}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
ʻono|ka poi|∅
delicious|the poi|∅
{/}

## Pepeke ʻAike He (Indicating a thing)

This form is used for "This/That is X" when X is not a person or a place.

{structure}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
article|thing|determiner
{/}

For example, _this is a man_.

{He kāne kēia}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
he|kāne|kēia
a|man|this
{/}

## Pepeke ʻAike ʻO (Indicating a person or place)

This form is used for "This/That is X" when X is a person or a place.

{structure}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
ʻo|person or place|determiner
{/}

For example, _this is Lani_.

{ʻO Lani kēia}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
ʻo|Lani|kēia
VOC|Lani|this
{/}

## Pepeke Henua (When or where something is)

<attn> When this form is used as a question, one may see the piko and ʻawe switch places.</attn>

This form could be broadly thought of as the "at" form, e.g "where you at?" or "when is it at?"

When used as a question _when/where_ as listed in the ʻawe will be either `āhea:when` or `i/ma hea:where`. When it is a statement, ex. I am here, _I_ and _ma_, without _hea_ can be used interchangeably.<cite>[KLʻO ep5](#ʻōiwi)</cite>

{structure}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
aia|subject|when/where
{/}

For example, _Mokulēʻia is in Waiālua_.

{ʻono ka poi}
**poʻo**|**piko**|**ʻawe**
aia|ʻo Mokulēʻia|i/ma Waiālua
LOC|Mokulēʻia|in Waiālua
{/}

--EX--
Aia i hea ka papaheʻenalu?
Where is the surfboard? // Note that the piko and ʻawe have switched places.
Aia i loko? A i ʻole aia i waho?
Is it inside? Or is it outside?
Aia ʻo Keaukaha i Hilo ma Hawaiʻi mokupuni.
Keaukaha is in Hilo on the island of Hawaiʻi.
--ENDEX--

# The ʻokina

It is important to note that the character that appears to be an apostrophe `'` or `ʼ` is in fact a letter `ʻ`, called the _ʻokina_. It looks more like a raised, tiny number 6, and in fact, in the Unicode standard, is called a "modifier letter turned comma".

The ʻokina represents a glottal stop, most often heard in English as the "stop" between _uh_ and _oh_ in _uh-oh_.
