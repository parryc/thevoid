# A Note on Spelling

While there is some standardization (especially coming from institutional sources, such as translations), it is often that if being told how to spell something by an individual, there may be dialetical spellings, hypercorrections, or loss of double vowels. To the best of my ability, this page includes standard spellings unless otherwise noted.

# Nouns

## Cases

Somali has 4 cases: 

* default (or absolutive): default case for all nouns, used when there is no object of a sentence
* subjective: used when there is an object of the sentence
* genitive: used for marking possession
* vocative: used for calling a person's name or in poetry

### Default/Absolutive (∅)

This case is unmarked, hence it being called the default case. It is used when there is no object of the sentence, such as in adjectival sentences. Such as in "she is nice", "she" would not change case

### Subjective (-u)

This case is used when there is an object in the sentence. In general, this is any non-adjectival sentence. It also appears to be used to mark the topic of a sentence. For example, <ex>_Cimiladu way fiicantanay_ ⧸ The weather, it is good</ex>. This is in contrast to the expected `cimilada:the weather`.

### Vocative

-ay female
-ow male

## Gender

Somali has two genders: masculine and feminine. Gender can only reliably be known if one also knows the definite article and so it is recommended to always learn the article with the noun. A noun's gender will also follow the "natural" gender of the noun, if one has one, e.g. a person's gender.

To really reinforce that gender here is purely linguistic, gender may switch between plural and singular forms for the same noun.

### Identifying Gender

**Masculine**

Definite articles _ka_, _ga_, _ha_, _a_.

**Feminine**

Definite articles _sha_, _ta_, _da_.

For example, `cimilada:the weather` ends in `-da`, so it is feminine. `guriga:the house` ends in `-ga`, so it is masculine.

The variation is due to sound changes that occur when the masculine (_ka_) and feminine (_ta_) definite articles are added to a noun.

## Pronouns

There are three types of personal pronouns in Somali: standalone, subject of a intransitive sentence (without an object), and subject of a transitive sentence (with an object).

### Standalone

Standalone pronouns follow casemarkings for nouns. When used in the subjective case, it is perceived as more formal than using just the subjective pronouns below. That is, _Iyadu waa ganacsato_ is seen as more formal than _Waxay tahay ganacsato_ (she is a business woman).

Open question: are annagu/innagu in free variation or are there dialect differences?

&nbps; | DEF | SUBJ
-------|-----|-----
1SG    |aniga|anigu
2SG    |adiga|adigu
3SG M. |isaga|isagu
3SG F. |iyada|iyadu
1PL    |annaga / innaga|annagu / innagu
2PL    |adinka / idinka|adinku / idinku
3PL    |ayaga|ayagu

### Default/Absolutive

Used when there is no object, such as in sentences with only a subject and an adjective.

&nbps; | SG  | PL
-------|-----|-----
1      |waan |waynu
2      |waad |waydin
3 M.   |wuu  |way
3 F.   |way  |way

### Subjective

Used when there is an object. Notice how it is the same as the default case, but with _-ax-_ inserted at the beginning.

&nbps; | SG    | PL
-------|-------|-----
1      |waxaan |waxaynu
2      |waxaad |waxaydin
3 M.   |waxuu  |waxay
3 F.   |waxay  |waxay

### Possessive

All possessive pronouns are suffixes and change based on the gender of the object being possessed. In their default form, masculine suffixes begin with _-k_ and feminine with _-t_, the exception being 3SG. With sound changes, it is not always static.

&nbps; | SG      | PL
-------|---------|-----
1      |-k/tayga |-k/teena, -k/taayaga
2      |-k/taaga |-k/tiina
3 M.   |-k/tiisa |-k/tooda
3 F.   |-k/teeda |-k/tooda

These suffixes are inclusive of the definite article (_-ka/ta_) and so they do not need to be additionally suffixed.

## Demonstratives

Demonstratives (this, that, etc.) differ based on the gender of the noun, but only in the singular. For plural (these, those), the worder is not differentiated by gender.

&nbsp; | near  | far
-------|-------|------
SG (M) | kan   | kaas
SG (F) | tan   | taas
PL     | kuwaan| kuwaas

These can be suffixed to the end of nouns, which will follow sound change rules. For example, `eygaas:that dog`.

--EX--
Kani waa maxaay? Kani waa wiil.
What is this? This is a boy. // this-masculine
Taasi waa maxaay? Taasi waa gabar.
What is that? That is a girl. // that-feminine
Kuwaani waa maxaay? Kuwaani waa doofaro.
What are these? These are pigs.
--ENDEX--

# Verbs

Verbs can be divided into 5 regular declensions, plus 6 irregular verbs.

Following Saeed 1993 and Zorc & Osman 1993, these will be v1, v2a, v2b, v3a, and v3b. When a listed suffix has an accent mark, that means that the accent shifts to the suffix. If no accent mark is listed, then the whole word is unaccented.

It looks like simple sentences are with _waa_ (or similar?):
Kani waa wiil/This is a boy
Reerkeygu wuu fiicanyahay/my family is good (f. noun)
Cimilada wey fiicantahay/the weather is good (m. noun)

Negative sentences with demonstratives are with "ma aha", which can be before or after the noun:

Kaasi ma aha ey/That is not a dog.
Tani bisad ma aha/This is not a cat.

Negative demonstrative questions are asked with _ma_ and _-aa_ on the noun - Kani ma wiilaa?/Is that not a boy? Plural nouns change from -o to -aa. Kuwaani ma doofaaraa? Kuwaani ma aha doofaaroo/Are these not pigs? They're not pigs.

In PRS.CONT/SIMP, Dahir gives _ii_ as the 2PL vowel for the suffix, whereas Saeed (and searching on the internet) give -taan. Is it dialetical? Dahir said _aa_ as vowel is informal.

## To Be

_To be_ uses the transitive pronouns.

&nbps; | SG | PL
-------|----|-----
1      |ahay|nahay
2      |tahay|tihiin
3      |yahay (m.) / tahay (f.) | yihiin

When the sentence is an adjective, the verb is suffixed to the adjective. If the subject is 1PL, then the _n_ of the verbal form is dropped, making it match the 1SG form.

--EX--
(Anigu) waxaan ahay arday.
I am a student. // Standalone pronouns are optional, note the vowel change at the end (_a_ to _u_).
Wuu fiicanyahay.
He is well/good.
--ENDEX--

## Imparative (IMP)

This is the default form of the verb and the lemma form found in most dictionaries. It is often used where other languages might have overt politeness markers, e.g. in requests.

### Negative Forms

When followed by a suffix in parentheses, it is (SG/PL).

# Sentence Structures

## And (iyo, oo, -(n)a, ee, -(y)e)

There are five different words/suffixes that correspond to the English "and", all of which have different uses.

iyo
: for linking nouns/noun phrases together

oo
: for linking verbs or clauses together

-na
: for linking clauses together, placed after the first grammatical unit in the 2nd clause. If the word ends in _-n_, then only _-a_ is attached.

ee
: for linking an impartive clause with a non-imparative clause or linking a negative and positive clause

-ye
: for linking an imparative and non-imparative clause. _-ye_ is suffixed to the "end of the statement".<cite>[Saeed, 274](#saeed)</cite> _Y_ is included when the word ends in a vowel.

--EX--
Magaceygu waa Parry, waxaana ku noolahay Mareykanka.
My name is Parry and I was born in America. // -na is attached to `waxaan:I`.
--ENDEX--

## Asking Questions

The generic question marker is _ma_. For example, <ex>Ma waxaad tahay macalin? ⧸ Are you a teacher?</ex>.

**Is it X? (ma X -(b)aa?)**

A demonstrative, suffixed with `-i`, can be placed in front of `ma`. For example, <ex>_Kaasi ma eyaa?_ ⧸ Is that a dog?</ex> (`kaas:that`).

The response to questions of this form is either `waa X:it is X` (positive form), or `ma aha X:it is not X` (negative form).

Northern (Somaliland) dialects will use `-baa`, whereas Southern dialects will use `-aa`.
