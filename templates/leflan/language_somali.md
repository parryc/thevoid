# A Note on Spelling

While there is some standardization (especially coming from institutional sources, such as translations), it is often that if being told how to spell something by an individual, there may be dialetical spellings, hypercorrections, or loss of double vowels. To the best of my ability, this page includes standard spellings unless otherwise noted.

# Nouns

## Pronouns

### Standalone

From my observation, there is a difference in the final vowel when the standalone pronoun is used in isolation, versus when part of a sentence.

Open question: are annagu/innagu in free variation or are there dialect differences?

#### Isolated

&nbps; | SG | PL
-------|----|-----
1      |aniga|annagu / innagu
2      |adiga|adinku / idinku
3      |isaga (m.) / iyada (f.) | ayagu


#### Part of a Sentence

&nbps; | SG | PL
-------|----|-----
1      |anigu|annaga/innaga
2      |adigu|adinka/idinka
3      |isagu (m.) / iyadu (f.) | ayaga


waxaan -- 1sg if transitive
waan -- 1sg if intransitive

## Cases

Vocative
-ay female
-ow male

## Demonstratives

Demonstratives (this, that, etc.) differ based on the gender of the noun, but only in the singular. For plural (these, those), the worder is not differentiated by gender.

&nbsp; | near  | far
-------|-------|------
sg (m) | kan   | kaas
sg (f) | tan   | taas
pl     | kuwaan| kuwaas

--EX--
Kani waa maxaay? Kani waa wiil.
What is this? This is a boy. // this-masculine
Taasi waa maxaay? Taasi waa gabar.
What is that? That is a girl. // that-feminine
Kuwaani waa maxaay? Kuwaani waa doofaro.
What are these? These are pigs.
--ENDEX--

# Verbs

It looks like simple sentences are with _waa_ (or similar?):
Kani waa wiil/This is a boy
Reerkeygu wuu fiicanyahay/my family is good (f. noun)
Cimilada wey fiicantahay/the weather is good (m. noun)

Negative sentences with demonstratives are with "ma aha", which can be before or after the noun:

Kaasi ma aha ey/That is not a dog.
Tani bisad ma aha/This is not a cat.

Negative demonstrative questions are asked with _ma_ and _-aa_ on the noun - Kani ma wiilaa?/Is that not a boy? Plural nouns change from -o to -aa. Kuwaani ma doofaaraa? Kuwaani ma aha doofaaroo/Are these not pigs? They're not pigs.

## To Be

_To be_ uses the transitive pronouns.

&nbps; | SG | PL
-------|----|-----
1      |ahay|nahay
2      |tahay|tihiin
3      |yahay (m.) / tahay (f.) | yihiin

--EX--
(Anigu) waxaan ahay arday.
I am a student. // Standalone pronouns are optional, note the vowel change at the end (_a_ to _u_).
--ENDEX--

## Imparative (IMP) ∅

This is the default form of the verb. It is often used where other languages might have overt politeness markers, e.g. in requests.

# Sentence Structures

## Asking Questions

The generic question marker is _ma_. For example, <ex>Ma waxaad tahay macalin? ⧸ Are you a teacher?</ex>.

**Is it X? (ma X -(b)aa?)**

A demonstrative, suffixed with `-i`, can be placed in front of `ma`. For example, <ex>_Kaasi ma eyaa?_ ⧸ Is that a dog?</ex> (`kaas:that`).

The response to questions of this form is either `waa X:it is X` (positive form), or `ma aha X:it is not X` (negative form).

Northern (Somaliland) dialects will use `-baa`, whereas Southern dialects will use `-aa`.
