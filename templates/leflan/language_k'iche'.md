## Introductory Note

The history of Mayan languages, from a documentary perspective, is one of consistent variation in written form and the dialect surveyed.For example, two edition of _Diccionario Quiché-Español_ by Abraham Garcia Hernandez and Santiago Yac Sam vary in orthography between the 2008 and the 1980 edition. This is not to mention the even greater variation with Munro Edmonson's 1965 _Quiche-English Dictionary_. As a result, the examples listed below may vary with one's own resources or elicitations by instructors. As Sergio Romero puts it, "K'ichee' shows substantial dialectal variation and dialect stereotypes are important ethnic markers for its speakers."<cite>[Romero 2016](#romero)</cite> So just lean in to the dialect and enjoy your journey with K'iche'!

## Nouns

There are two types of person markers in K'iche': possession markers and independent personal pronouns. In linguistics texts about the language, they are referred to as Set A and Set B, respectively, as these person markers are also used to mark the subject and object in verbs. 

### Possession (Set A)

&nbsp; | followed by C | followed by V
-------|---------------|-----------------
1sg    | nu-           | w-
2sg    | a-            | aw-
3sg    | u-            | r-
1pl    | qa-           | q-
2pl    | i-            | iw-
3pl    | ki-           | k-

In formal speech, the 2sg and 2pl lose the prefix and instead are followed by the politeness markers `la` and `alaq`. For example, `achi'l la:your (sg, pol) friend`.

When used in a verb where the root starts with a consonant, the 1st person singular `nu-` becomes `in-`, under influence from the independent personal pronoun, ex. `kinna'o:I feel it`.

### Personal Pronouns (Set B)

 &nbsp; |sg  |pl
-|----|--
1|in  |uj
2|at  |ix
3|are'|e' (are')

2nd person polite forms (sg/pl): la(l) and alaq. In colloquial speech _e'_ is used more often than _e' are'_ for the 3rd person plural.

When used in verbs, the 3sg is unmarked (∅) and 3pl is _e'_.

## Prefixes

aj
: the "profession marker". All professions have this prefix: `ajtijonel:teacher`, `ajtijoxel:pupil`.

### Names

Names are preceded by an prefix, based on the respect and the gender of the person attached to the name. In some writing, they may be written with a space before the word. However, the informal female name prefix should still be prononuced as if it were a attached.

&nbsp; | m.  | f.
-------|-----|------
inf.   | a   | al
pol.   | tat | nan

--EX--
Nub'i a Jaime.
My name is Jaime.
--ENDEX--

## Verbs

The verb in K'iche' contains 4 potential parts:

1. Aspect
2a. Person (subject)
2b. Person (object)
3. Root
4. (Optional) Termination, Politeness marker, or Future marker

These will vary based on whether or not verb is intransitive (no object) or transitive (has an object).

Aspect
: Aspect is either complete or incomplete. Incomplete aspect is marked with a `k` or `ka` in front of _b'_ or _p_. Completed aspect is marked with `x`.

Intransitive verbs
: The subject marker for intransitive verbs is always a personal pronoun (Set B).

{kinb'ek:I go}
aspect|subject|root|term
**k**|**in**|**b'e**|**k**
incomplete|B1sg|go|∅
{/}

Transitive verbs
: The subject marker for transitive verbs is always a possessive pronoun (Set A), varying based on the first letter of the root, so either a preconsonantal or a prevocalic possessive pronoun. The object marker is always a personal pronoun (Set B).

{kinrilo:He sees you}
aspect|object|subject|root|status
**k**|**at**|**r**|**il**|**o**
incomplete|B1sg|A3sg|see|∅
{/}

Status marker (this needs some refinement)
: For transitive verbs, it is either _ik_ if the root ends with a consonant, or _k_, if the verb ends with a vowel. This marker only appears if the verb is the end of the sentence. For intransitive verbs, Mondlach and Can Pixabaj both list `-o` (such as in `ilo:to see`) as the same type of termination marker, but Junkan leaves it on even when the verb isn't sentence final, ex. <ex>_Iwir xatwilo pa k'ayab'al_ ⧸ Yesterday I saw you at the market.</ex> Junkan gives `-m` as something akin to a subjunctive, adding a meaning of "to try" to a verb, such as <ex>_La ana'om ri pasta?_ ⧸ Have you tried pasta?</ex>

Future marker
: It is _na_, ex. _kwilo na_, I will see.

### State of Being

There is no copula in K'iche', meaning there is no conjugated form of 'to be' in a sentence that describes what something is. One simply uses the personal pronoun followed by what the person is. For example, _in kosnaq_, I am tired.

To express where one is, the personal pronoun is used with _k'o pa_. For example, <ex>_In k'o pa Iximulew_ ⧸ I am in Guatemala.</ex>

### To Have

There is no verb that specifically means "to have". Rather, having something is done with the existential verb `k'o:there is`. It is of the form `k'o {POSS}{NOUN}`, thus _k'o nuwaram:I have a dream_, _k'o awaram:you have a dream_.

If the sentence is not existential, ex. you have something of mine, the preposition `uk':with` is used. Thus, "You have my money" is _K'o awuk' nupwaq_, literally "there is my money with you".

Questions asking if one has something can be answered with `ye':yes` or `k'olik:there is` in the affirmative, or `maj:no, there is not` in the negative.

## Articles

There is only a definitive article ("the") in K'iche', which does not change for pluarlity or gender. It is `le`, `le ikan:the uncle`. If one must explicate that it is more than one of the object, then the word `taq` is used: `le taq ikan:the uncles`. 

## Prepositions

uk'
: with. Prefixed with the possessive prefixes, thus `wuk':with me` and `awuk':with you`.

ch-e
: for. Infixed with the possessive prefixes, thus `chwe:for me` and `chawe:for you`.

## Numbers

K'iche' is a vigesimal (base 20) language. Mayan numerals are in parentheses, they are most often written vertically (such as on the Guatemalan Quetzal), with the 1s place at the bottom.

## Miscellaneous

### Negation

Negation occurs by surrounding the word to be negated with `man...taj`. Mondlach, gives an alternative for of `na...ta(j)`, where `taj` is only used if it is sentence final.<cite>[Mondlach, 53](#mondlach)</cite> This is also reflected in CLQK, indicating that the `na...ta(j)` form may be emblematic of the Nahualá dialect.

`Maj` can be used as an abbreviated form of `man k'o taj`, that is "there/he is not". Mondlach gives it as the 3sg of the positional aspect negative form of `k'oji':to be`.<cite>[Mondlach, 184](#mondlach)</cite>

--EX--
Man k'o taj tew.
I am not cold. // lit. There is no cold.
Man utz taj nuwach.
I am not well.
--ENDEX--
