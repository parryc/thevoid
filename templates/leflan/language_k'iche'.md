## Nouns

### Pronouns

 &nbsp; |sg  |pl
-|----|--
1|in  |uj
2|at  |ix
3|are'|e' are'

2nd person polite forms (sg/pl): la(l) and alaq.

## Prefixes

aj
: the "profession marker". All professions have this prefix: `ajtijonel:teacher`, `ajtijoxel:pupil`.

### Names

Names are preceded by an prefix, based on the respect and the gender of the person attached to the name. In some writing, they may be written with a space before the word. However, the informal female name prefix should still be prononuced as if it were a attached.

&nbsp; | m.  | f.
-------|-----|------
inf.   | a   | al
pol.   | tat | nan

--EX--
Nub'i a Jaime.
My name is Jaime.
--ENDEX--

### Posession

&nbsp; | followed by C | followed by V
-------|---------------|-----------------
1sg    | nu-           | w-
2sg    | a-            | aw-
3sg    | u-            | r-
1pl    | qa-           | q-
2pl    | i-            | iw-
3pl    | ki-           | k-

In formal speech, the 2sg and 2pl lose the prefix and instead are followed by the politeness markers `la` and `alaq`. For example, `achi'l la:your (sg, pol) friend`.

## Verbs

The verb in K'iche' contains 4 potential parts:

1. Aspect
2. Person
3. Root
4. (Optional) Termination or Politeness marker

Aspect refers to whether or not the verb is complete or incomplete; person refers to who is performing the verb (and optionally, who is receipient of the verb); the root, which is unchanging; and optionally either a termination ender, if at the end of a sentence or the politeness marker, if the subject is the 2nd person.

{keb'ek:they go}
aspect|pronoun|root|term
**k**|**e**|**b'e**|**k**
incomplete|3pl|go|∅
{/}

* Aspect is either complete or incomplete. Incomplete aspect is marked with a `k` or `ka` in front of _b'_ or _p_. Completed aspect is marked with `x`.

* Person is the same as the personal pronouns except the 3sg is unmarked (∅) and 3pl is _e_. In the case of the polite 2sg or 2pl, no personal pronoun is used. Instead, the politeness markers _la_/_alaq_ are used after the verb. The 1sg becomes _im_ in front of _b'_ and _p_.

* The Termination marker can be thought of a euphonic marker as it has no meaning. It is either _ik_ if the root ends with a consonant, or _k_, if it ends with a vowel. This marker only appears if the verb is the end of the sentence.

### State of Being

There is no copula in K'iche', meaning there is no conjugated form of 'to be' in a sentence that describes what something is. One simply uses the personal pronoun followed by what the person is. For example, _in kosnaq_, I am tired.

### To Have

There is no verb that specifically means "to have". Rather, having something is done with the existential verb `k'o:there is`. It is of the form `k'o {POSS}{NOUN}`, thus _k'o nuwaram:I have a dream_, _k'o awaram:you have a dream_.

If the sentence is not existential, ex. you have something of mine, the preposition `uk':with` is used. Thus, "You have my money" is _K'o awuk' nupwaq_, literally "there is my money with you".

Questions asking if one has something can be answered with `ye':yes` or `k'olik:there is` in the affirmative, or `maj:no, there is not` in the negative.

## Articles

There is only a definitive article ("the") in K'iche', which does not change for pluarlity or gender. It is `le`, `le ikan:the uncle`. If one must explicate that it is more than one of the object, then the word `taq` is used: `le taq ikan:the uncles`. 

## Numbers

K'iche' is a vigesimal (base 20) language. Mayan numerals are in parentheses, they are most often written vertically (such as on the Guatemalan Quetzal), with the 1s place at the bottom.

## Miscellaneous

### Negation

Negation occurs by surrounding the word to be negated with `man...taj`. Mondlach, gives an alternative for of `na...ta(j)`, where `taj` is only used if it is sentence final.<cite>[Mondlach, 53](#mondlach)</cite> This is also reflected in CLQK, indicating that the `na...ta(j)` form may be emblematic of the Nahualá dialect.

`Maj` can be used as an abbreviated form of `man k'o taj`, that is "there/he is not". Mondlach gives it as the 3sg of the positional aspect negative form of `k'oji':to be`.<cite>[Mondlach, 184](#mondlach)</cite>

--EX--
Man k'o taj tew.
I am not cold. // lit. There is no cold.
Man utz taj nuwach.
I am not well.
--ENDEX--
