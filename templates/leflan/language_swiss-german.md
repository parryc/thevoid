## Regular Verbs

There are 4 classes of regular verbs. they are more or less the same, but differ in where additional vowels are placed in the 2nd and 3rd person singular. In all cases, the pluarl suffixes are the same, `-ed`. The root, upon which these endings are attached, is found by taking the dictionary form and removing the final `e`. Thus, `bringe` → `bring`.

Armin refers to these 4 classes as A, B1, B2, and C.

### Present Tense (PRS)

PL     |bringed  |hebed  |bhaled    |butzed

* B1 adds _e_ in 3SG.
* C adds _i_ in 2SG.
* B2 adds both.

## Seperable Verbs

Some verbs have detachable prefixes, conventionally indicating the way something is done (e.g. as a direction), but are also fossilized formations. For example, the _aa_, _ab_, etc. attached to `aafange:to begin` and `abbüüge:to turn`. When there is an object, the prefix moves to the end of the clause. For example, <ex>Si stellt de Stroom aa. ⧸ She turns on the electricity</ex>.

# Nouns

<attn>Nouns are negated with _kei_, not _nöd_. _Nöd_ is often pronounced with a long _ö_ when sentence final.</attn>

Nouns are divided into three classes, masculine, feminine, and neutral.

According to Hoi, pg 10, the standard 4 noun cases of High German are reduced to two: common (NOM, ACC) and dative (DAT, GEN). However, some speakers say that the ACC and NOM are distinct.<cite>Armin</cite>

## Pronouns

<attn>If the 2nd person plural is used as the polite form, the pronouns must be capitalized.</attn>

Number | NOM    | DAT   | ACC  
-------|--------|-------|------
1s.    | ich    | mir   |    
2s.    | du     | dir   | dich
3sm.   | er     | sich  |  
3sf.   | si     | sich  |  
3sn.   | es     |       |  
1p.    | mir    | üs    |  
2p.    | si     | ine   | sii
3p.    | ir     | sich  |  

## Articles

Most articles in Swiss German are single letters. However, two, the masculine definite article, `de` and the feminine indefinite article, `e`, have variations. `de` becomes `der` and `e` becomes `en` if followed by a vowel.

`de/der` is also used when making introductions and sometimes with countries (ex. _der USA_ or _der Schwiiz_). For example, <ex>Ich bi der Armin ⧸ I am Armin</ex>.

Class | Def. | Indef. | Plural
------|------|--------|--------
masc. | de(r)| en     | d
fem.  | d    | e(n)   | d
neut. | s    | es     | d

## Pronunciation

Due to the difficulty of pronouncing some consonant clusters, the pronunciation (but not written form) of article+noun pairs can change. In the list below, the capital letter indicates the start of the noun.

* d + F = pF
* d + Ch = gCh
* d + B = P
* d + D = T
* d + G = gG
* d + K/P/T/Z = K/P/T/Z, but said with more force

# Adjectives

<attn>Nouns are negated with _kei_, not _nöd_.</attn>

Add `n` if ends in vowel and following adjective begins with a vowel. For example, `gueten aabig:good night`.

# Sentence Structures

## Liking something (gèrn)

Liking to do something can be expressed with the conjugated verb plus _gèrn_. For example, <ex>Ich lise gèrn Gschichtsbüecher ⧸ I like reading history books</ex>. In the negative, use `nöd:not` between the verb and _gèrn_. Thus, <ex>Ich lise nöd gèrn Gschichtsbüecher ⧸ I like reading history books</ex>.

## Negation (kei and nöd)

nöd for negating how you are doing something and kei for when you are not something or don't have something

I am kei a good student
and the sweater is nöd under the table

sort of a how vs what dichotomy

I think that the ending of kei also changes based on the gender of the following noun?

kei Schoggi
kein Öpfelchueche
keis Schuelbüech

## Emphasis

Swiss German has two different forms of emphatic sentence forms.

① Duplication of `gaa:to go`
: Used to emphasis the activity that's going to be done. Formed by conjugating _gaa_ and then following the noun with _go_.

② `tue:to do`
:Formed by conjugating _tue_ and placing the infinitive form of the verb at the end of the clause. Can emphasize the activity being done or that the activity is currently occurring.

--EX--
Dänn gaat si go poschte.
Then she went to go shopping. // ①
Ich tue Fuessball spile.
I'm playing football right now. // ②
--ENDEX--

# Suffixes

li
: diminutive suffix. Never append to `Franken:Swiss Franks`, as Germans use it to make fun of the Swiss.

# Postpositions

ume
: around, `Elfi ume:Around 11 o'clock`.

# Numbers

## Cardinal Numbers

Teens are formed by adding `zä` to the end of the single number, except for 11 and 12, which have their own forms. Tens are more or less formed by appending `zg`. Numbers such as 21 or 22 are formed by `{ones} + e + {tens}`, except for numbers one and seven, which use `ne`, and 80, which require a `d` before `achtzg`.

0 - null
1 - äis
2 - zwäi
3 - drüü
4 - vier
5 - föif
6 - sächs
7 - sibe
8 - acht
9 - nüün
10 - zää
11 - elf
12 - zwölf
13 - drizä
20 - zwänzg
21 - äinezwänzg
25 - föifezwänzg

90 - nüünzg
100 - hundert
101 - hundertäis

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers are created by appending additional letters, depending on the number. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd do not append anything.

1st - eerscht
2nd - zwäit
3rd - dritt

4th-12th: `+t`
4th - viert

13th-19th: `+ät`
13th - drizäät

Tens: `+ischt`
20th - zwängzgischt

Hundreds/Thousands: `+scht`
100th - hundertscht

## Ages and Hours

Both ages and hours are said by appending `+i` to the number, or `+ni`, if the number ends in a vowel. Note that when saying one's age, `+(n)i` is only appended when _not_ saying `Jaar alt:years old` after the number.

--EX--
Wie alt bisch du?
Ich bi achtezwängzgi. // I am 28.
--ENDEX--

## Prices

Prices can be said in three forms:

* {num} Franke {num} Rappe
* {num} Franke {num}
* {num}.{num} (where the period is a pause)

--EX--
Wie viil choschtet das?
What does that cost?
s Rivella choschtet zwäi Franke füfzg Rappe.
The Rivella costs 2 Franks and 50 cents. // Rivella is a type of Swiss pop
--ENDEX--

# Time

There are 4 different time phrases, depending on the minutes being said.

* Exact hour: punkt {hour}-i
* 01-29: {minutes} ab {hour}-i
* 30: halbi {hour + 1}-i
* 31-59: {minutes} vor {hour + 1}-i

Thus:

* 8:00, punkt achti
* 8:14, vierzä ab achti
* 8:30, halbi nüüni
* 8:47, drizä vor nüüni

Note that quarter hours are also said as `viertel`. Some variations may also occur near the :30 mark. For example, 10:25 may be read as _föif vor halbi elfi_, 5 to half (before) eleven.

If reading the exact time, number for number, the 0 in times like 9:08 is often read for clarity.
