## Nouns

### ANG Pronouns

ANG pronouns serve as the topic of a sentence. 

 sg      | pl
---------|----
 ako     | kami
 ka/ikaw | kayo
 siya    | 

_kayo_ can also be used as the 2nd-person singular polite pronoun as well. _ikaw_ differs from _ka_ in that it can be used at the beginning of a sentence or by itself.

### NG Pronouns

NG pronouns serve as anything but topic of a sentence, ex. possessive pronoun.

 sg | pl
----|----
 ko |
 mo |
    |

## Verbs

### Present Tense

Conjugation is performed in two steps:

1. Double the first CV of the root
2. Add any appropriate prefix

For example, with root `galak:to please`.

1. ga + galak
2. ikina + gagalak
3. `ikinagagalak:pleases` (In the sense of "I am pleased to meet you.")

### Prefixex

ikina
: indicates why the subject pefroms an action, _ikinagagalak kong makilala ka_ - by meeting/knowing you, I am pleased.

## Particles

ang
: topic marker

na
: "Indicates an action has happened or is happening and its occurance was expected."<cite>Mango Languages</cite> One of two particles that occur after the first ful word in a sentence. Ex. _kamusta na po kayo?_:How have you been, ma'am?. If there is a single syllable pronoun, then it comes at the end: _kamusta ka na?_:How have you been?

naman
: adds politeness or certainty to a response. Ex. _Mabuti naman ako_:I am fine.

si/sina
: _si_ is the topic marker for personal names. _sina_ is for multiple people. Ex. _kamusta si Juan?_:How is Juan?

## Adjectives

Add `ng` after an adjective that ends in a vowel, when it precedes a noun. Ex. _magandang umaga_:good morning, but literally "beautiful morning".  _Maganda_ is beautiful.

## Politeness

Politeness is marked with `po` at the end of a sentence or phrase, ex. _magandang umaga po_:good morning (sir/ma'am).

## Sentence Structure

The basic structure of a Tagalog sentence is `PREDICATE TOPIC`, ex. _Kamusta ka?_. _Kamusta_ is the predicate (how are) and _ka_ (you) is the topic.
