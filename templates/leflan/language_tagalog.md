[TOC]

Note: An accent mark over a vowel indicates that that syllable has stress. It is included randomly, since I don't always explicitly mark it in my notes.

## Nouns

_mga_ (pronounced _manga_) is used to form plurals, ex. _mga restawran_:restaurants. _Mga_ is not used when a number is used, ex. _limang piso_:5 pesos.

_kita_ is the "dual" pronoun, which is used when one expects both a 1sg and a 2sg pronoun. For example, _Hindi kita marinig_:I can't hear you.

### ANG Pronouns

ANG pronouns serve as the topic of a sentence. 

 sg       | pl
----------|----
 ako      | kami/tayo
 ka/ikaw  | kayo
 siya     | sila

_kayo_ can also be used as the 2nd-person singular polite pronoun as well. _ikaw_ differs from _ka_ in that it can be used at the beginning of a sentence or by itself.

_tayo_ is the inclusive 1st person plural.

When _ka_ is followed by a particle like _lamang_:just or _lang_:just, it is not followed by _ng_, ex. _maglakad ka lang_:just walk!

Demonstrative ANG pronouns are as follows:

* _ito_ – this (near me)
* _iyan_ - that (near you)
* _iyon_ – that over there (far from you and me)

### NG Pronouns

NG pronouns serve as anything but topic of a sentence, ex. possessive pronoun. That is _ang_ cannot be used with these pronuns.

 sg   | pl
------|----
 ko   | namin/natin
 mo   | ninyo
 niya | nila

_namin_ is exclusive, whereas _natin_ is inclusive.

Demonstrative NG pronouns are as follows:

* _nito_ – this (near me)
* _niyan_ - that (near you)
* _niyon/noon_ – that over there (far from you and me)

### SA Pronouns

Unlike NG pronouns above, these pronouns can be used with the _sa_ particle (this is not the locative one).

  sg   | pl
-------|----
 akin  | amin/atin
 iyo   | inyo   
 kanya | kanila

_amin_ is exclusive, whereas _atin_ is inclusive.

Demonstrative SA pronouns are as follows:

* _dito/rito_ – this (near me)
* _diyan/riyan_ - that (near you)
* _doon/roon_ – that over there (far from you and me)

The _d_ and _r_ varies based on the preceding word. If it is a vowel, _w_, or _y_ it will be the _r_ form, otherwise _d_. 

## Verbs

Verbs in Tagalog are formed from a root word plus affixes to change tense, aspect, and occasionally meaning. The two forms of verbs are UM (_-um-_) and MAG (_mag-_). Many roots can be conjugated in both forms. In the below sections _ro_ (from _root_) is used to indicate the first CV pair in the word. When there is no initial C, then only the first V is used. For example, _ro_ for _tuma_ would be _tu_ and _ro_ for _iyak_ would be _i_. Table examples are taken from [Basic Tagalog for Foreigners and Non-Tagalogs, 72-73](#aspillera).

Serial verbs are in the form of `verb1 noun+ng verb2`, thus _gusto ninyong subukan_:you want to try.

### UM verbs

If the verb starts with a consonant, _um_ is infixed between the first consonant and the first vowel. If the verb starts with a vowel, _um_ is prefixed.

tense | conjugation | example
------|-------------|----------
root  | ∅           | alis (a departure), kain (the consumption of food)
infinitive | um + _root_ | umalis (to leave), kumain (to eat)
imperative | um + _root_ | umalis, kumain
past | um + _root_ | umalis, kumain
present | _r_ + -um- + _o_ + _root_ | umaalis, kumakain
future | _ro_ + _root_ | aalis, kakain

### MAG verbs

If the verb begins with a vowel, _mag_ is followed by a hyphen, indicating a glottal stop.

tense | conjugation | example
------|-------------|----------
root  | ∅           | aral (a lesson), luto (cuisine)
infinitive | mag + _root_ | mag-aral (to study), magluto (to cook)
imperative | mag + _root_ | mag-aral, magluto
past | nag + _root_ | nag-aral, nagluto
present | nag + _ro_ + _root_ | nag-aaral, nagluluto
future | mag + _ro_ + _root_ | mag-aaral, magluluto

### Pseudo-Verbs

Pseudo-verbs are a type of adjective "which have verb-like meaning, but [...] are incapable of inflection to show variation in aspect".<cite>[TRG](#trg), §4.21</cite>

pseudo-verb | approximate english equivalent
------------|------------
ayaw        | doesn't like to
kailangan   | needs to
dapat       | ought to
gusto       | wants to
ibig        | likes to
maaari      | can, may
nais        | likes to
puwede      | can, may

### Aspect

There are three main types of aspect in Tagalog, plus one occasional aspect, depending on the verb. These are:

* Completed
* Uncompleted
* Unstarted
* (Optional) Recently Completed

These are commonly indicated by either _in_ or _ni_ infixed in the root. For example, using _sabihin:to say_, from _sabi:something said_.

* Completed: _sinabi_ "I said (and am done)"
* Uncompleted: _sinasabi_ "I am saying (and haven't finished)"
* Unstarted: _sasabihin_ "I haven't started saying"

For more information on aspect in Tagalog, see [Tagalog Reference Grammar, 369](#trg) or [De Vos, 208-209](#devos).

## Particles

ay
: switches from Predicate + Topic to Topic + Predicate, ex. _Ang pangalan ko ay..._:My name is...

ang
: topic marker.  In rapid speech, it is often dropped, or if the preceding word begins with a vowel, realized as _-ng_. It is often found after question words.

daw/raw
: a partical indicating heresay

kasi
: because

may
: existential particle. Indicates something exists, loosely translated as "there is". Ex. _May bangko dito_:There is a bank here.

na
: "Indicates an action has happened or is happening and its occurance was expected."<cite>[Mango Languages](#mango)</cite> One of two particles that occur after the first full word in a sentence. Ex. _kamusta na po kayo?_:How have you been, ma'am?. If there is a single syllable pronoun, then it comes at the end: _kamusta ka na?_:How have you been? It also had idiomatic emphatic usage – good luck.

nasa
: on, it. Ex. _Nasa mapa ba iyon?_:Is it on the map?.

naman
: adds politeness or certainty to a response. Ex. _Mabuti naman ako_:I am fine.

pa
: still, more, else

sa
: in, through, at. Ex. _Diyan lang sa labasa sa kabila_:Just there through the exit on the other side.

si/sina
: _si_ is the topic marker for personal names. _sina_ is for multiple people. Ex. _kamusta si Juan?_:How is Juan?

--EX--
May pamaypay ba kayo?
Do you have fans?
Nagbebenta ba kayo ng mga diksunaryo?
Do you sell dictionaries?
Ano ang sa inyo?
What will you have/order?
Masarap daw itong kare-kare.
They say the kare-kare is delicious.
Ano pa?
What else?
--ENDEX--

### ba

_ba_ is the question particle. It follows pronouns with one syllable. In a sentence without a monosyllabic pronoun, _ba_ follows the first full word, including any "small" words like _po_. If it comes between an adjective an its noun, it takes the _ng_ linker. 

_ba_ is optional in questions using a question word.<cite>[De Vos, 394](#devos)</cite> 

--EX--
Nagsasalita ka ba ng Tagalog?
Can you speak Tagalog?
Nasa mapa ba iyon?
Is it on the map?
May malapit bang ospital dito?
Is there a hospital near here?
May malapit po ba kayo?
Are you sick, sir?
--ENDEX--


## Adjectives

Add `ng` after an adjective that ends in a vowel, when it precedes a noun. Ex. _magandang umaga_:good morning, but literally "beautiful morning".  _Maganda_ is beautiful. When the adjective ends in a vowel, use _na_ instead, ex. _apat na sumbrero_:4 hats.

pang
: an instrumental-like prefix for adjectives. It changes a noun into an adjective with the general of meaning of "used for {noun}", ex. _panghimagas_:for dessert<cite>[De Vos, 256](#devos)</cite>

mas
: comparative marker, ex. _mas malapit_:nearer

--EX--
Baka gusto ninyong subukan ang aming kakanin panghimagas
You might want to try our rice pudding for dessert // literally our for-dessert rice pudding
--ENDEX--

## Question Words

alin
: which, functions as an adjective, ex. _aling istasyon ng pulis?_:which police station?

ano
: what

bakit
: why

kailan
: when

magkàno
: how much

nasaan
: where, specifically where something moveable (ex. a person) is. Contrast with _saan_.

paano
: how

saan
: where, specifically where an action takes place or something immoveable is. Contrast with _nasaan_.

sino
: who

--EX--
Ano ang pangalan mo?
What is your name?
Paano ako makapupunta roon?
How can I go there?
Nasaan ang sukil ko?
Where is my change? // Since "change" is non-stationary, we use _nasaan_ 
Saan ang sakayan ng dyip?
Where is the jeepney terminal? // Since the "jeepney terminal" is stationary, we use _saan_
Taga-saan ka?
Where are you from?
Sino ang kasama mong nagbiyahe?
Who traveled with you?
Paano sabihin ang "cat" sa Tagalog?
How do you say "cat" in Tagalog?
--ENDEX--

## Prefixes

ikina
: indicates why the subject pefroms an action, _ikinagagalak kong makilala ka_ - by meeting/knowing you, I am pleased.

ka
: indicates a likeness to the root, ex. _kakanin_:like rice<cite>[De Vos, 84](#devos)</cite>

ma¹
: politeness prefix, similar to _pa_, ex. _maupo_:please sit.

ma²
: changes a noun into an adjective<cite>[De Vos, 246](#devos)</cite>

ma³
: changes a noun into the verb of being able to do that noun, ex. _ma_ + _rinig_ = _be able to_ + _hear_ = _to be able to hear_<cite>[De Vos, 136, ma4](#devos)</cite>

mag
: a verb forming prefix used with a noun or adjective, ex. _mag-dyip_:to take a jeepney.

nakaka
: causing or producing the root word<cite>[De Vos, 251](#devos)</cite>, ex. _tawa_:laughter, _nakakatawa_:funny, that is, something that is _nakakatawa_ creates laughter. An alternative form is seen in [Tagalog Conjugations, page 17](#tc) as _naka_ + first syllable, thus _lungkot_:depression → _nakalulungkot_:depressing.

napaka
: intesifier, ex. _napakasakit_:hurts a lot. It is always followed by _ng_ when modifying a noun, ex. _napakasakit ng tiyan_:stomach hurts a lot.<cite>[TC, 17](#tc)</cite> Connects directly to root (so when connecting to a _ma-_ adjective, the _ma_ is dropped).<cite>[De Vos, 259](#devos)</cite>

pa
: action prefix, used with verbs to make requests, ex. _pabili_:I'll get...

paki
: request prefix, longer form of _pa_

pinaka
: superlative, ex. _pinakamalapit_:nearest

taga
: a noun-forming prefix that denotes the origin of something, ex. _taga-saan ka?_:where are you from?, `saan:where`.

## Postfixes

in
: indicates the verb it is attached to requires an object, ex. _subukan_:taste {something}<cite>[De Vos, 109](#devos)</cite> If _an_ is added, an _o_ in the last syllable is changed to _u_, ex. _subok_ → _subukan_ (will taste {something}).

in
: indicates the verb it is attached to requires an object, ex. _kainin_:eat {something}<cite>[De Vos, 120](#devos)</cite> If _in_ is added, an _o_ in the last syllable is changed to _u_, ex. _inom_ → _iinumin_ (will drink {something}).

ng
: links between two verbs, ex. `pwedeng magtanong:can (I) ask?`, where _pwede_ is the standalone form. It also links two adjectives, noun+adj, qp+adv, noun+adv. Pretty much it links everything together constantly. Put it between every word, it'll be fun! Without doing much research, it looks like it marks the phrase which is modified by the following word, cf. _bang_ in _May bangko bang malapit dito?_:Is there a bank near here?. It is often assimilated to _m_ in casual speech.

## Politeness

Politeness is marked with `po` at the end of a sentence or phrase, ex. _magandang umaga po_:good morning (sir/ma'am).

nga
: comes after `na` in a sentence, converts commands into polite requests. Ex. _Ano nga ulit ang pangalan mo?_:What is your name again?

## Sentence Structure

The basic structure of a Tagalog sentence is `PREDICATE TOPIC`, ex. _Kamusta ka?_. _Kamusta_ is the predicate (how are) and _ka_ (you) is the topic.  De Vos describes a sentence as having two general types of information: the point of departure (POD) and the news.<cite>[De Vos, 35](#devos)</cite> This is more commonly described as a topic (POD) and comment (News) structure. Basically, there is something the sentence is about and something that describes the thing being spoken about. It often corresponds to English's subjects (topic) and object (comment), but it is not strictly true, ex. verbs may be topics. 

The POD is either preceded by _ang_ or unspoken (a contextually relevant topic, such as a person already spoken about). The News is preceded by _ng_ (pronounced _nang_).

Question words and `hindi:not` invert the `PREDICATE TOPIC` structure, ex. _Hindi kami tumatanggap ng credit cards_:We do not accept credit cards. Notice that _kami_ follows _hindi_, rather than the predicate, _tumatanggap_.

--EX--
Ano ang kakainin mo?
What will you be eating? // _ang_ indicates the verb "to eat" is the topic
Gusto ko ng panghimagas.
I want dessert. // simplest equivalent of an SVO sentence in English: VERB + NG-Pronoun + _ng_ + OBJECT
--ENDEX--

### Negation

_hindi_ negates sentences. Additionally, the pronoun comes before the verb. Ex. _Hindi ako nagasaslita_:I do not speak.

### Predicative Adjectives

Tagalog has predicative adjectives.<cite>[WALS, chp. 118, ex. 8](#wals)</cite> This means that adjectives can stand by themselves in sentences (i.e. as [predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar))), without the need for overt verbs. For example, _Medyo masakit ang ulo ko_:My head hurts a bit. There is no equivalent to "hurts", rather _medyo masakit_ is closer to "a little painful". Thus, "a little painful, my head".

## Numbers

* 1 – isà
* 2 – dalawà
* 3 – tatlò
* 4 – àpat
* 5 – limà
* 6 – ànim
* 7 – pitò
* 8 – walò
* 9 – siyàm
* 10 – sampù
* 20 – dalawampu
* 40 – apatnapu
* 100 – daan/raan
* 1000 – lìbo

The linker _ng_ is used when combining numbers, such as _isang daan_:100.
When a tens has a ones place, the linker is _'t_ (an abbreviation of _at_:and), ex. _dalawampu't lima_:25. Only the first number before the item being counted will contain the linker.

The tens are merged form of `number` + sampu. In the case of 40, it is _apat_ + _na_ + _sampu_.

Teens are formed by _labing_ + `number`. When `number` begins with a vowel, it is _labing-_ (_labing-isa_:11), when it is a consonant, it is _labin_ (_labindalawa_:12), and when it is 17, it is _labimpito_.

In many cases (telling time, randomly), Spanish numbers are used instead of the native Tagalog. In these cases, rather than `'t` as _and_, `'y` is used.

--EX--
Apatnapu't anim na piso sitenta'y sinko sentimas
46 pesos and 75 cents // notice both that only one linker (_na_) is used and that the cents are in Spanishified numbers
