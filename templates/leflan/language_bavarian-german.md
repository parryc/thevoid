# On Dialect

The notes below are in the context of the Austrian dialect. Pronunciation, spelling, word choice, etc. will as such be slightly different than if you are coming from a more Munich/German focus. Additionally, between ages, urban vs. rural, city vs. city, there will be variation, not just in dialect versions, but the use of dialect vs. standard German. Please let me know if your regional variation is missing and I will gladly add it.

Often the first way that I encountered it will be written as the "definitive" version. Variations will be indicated with "ùïØ".

# On Spelling

As an informally or colloquially written language, there are almost as many ways of writing as there are speakers. As many of the spellings for grammatical items I know of are listed as appropriate. These will often be indicated with "ùïØ", unless originally taught to me as a free variation.

# Nouns

## Gender

There are three genders: masculine, feminine, and neutral. These are represented as M, F, and N in the tables below. Outside of natural gender (e.g. that is a female chicken, that is a male scorpion), it is not always possible to identify the gender of a noun based on spelling.

There are a few rules to help, though:

- those ending in _-ung_ are always female

## Plural Pronouns

There a number of different ways the plural can be formed:

1. +a: `kind:child` -> `kinda:children`
2. umlaut (changing of the vowel): `haus:house` -> `heisa:houses`
3. 

# Pronouns

## Personal Pronouns

Number | NOM    | ACC   | DAT   
-------|--------|-------|-------
1SG    | i      |       | ma    
2SG    | du     |       | da

2PL    | √©s/e√ü/iah |    | eich  
3PL    | s√©/sie |       | eana  

* some speakers will use wir/ihr as in standard German for 1PL and 2PL.

## Posessive Pronouns

TODO: actually needs to be per case, per person
1SG: NOM - mei/mei/?/meine / DAT (mit?) meim/meina/?/?

Number | NOM    | ACC   | DAT   
-------|--------|-------|-------
1SG    |        |       |       
2SG    |        |       |      
3SG.M  |        |       |     
3SG.F  |        |       |     
3SG.N  |        |       |      
1PL    |        |       |    
2PL    |        |       |   
3PL    |        |       |   


## Relative Pronouns

"who/which"

NOM | dea | die |des
ACC | dem 
DAT | dem

## Articles

ùïØ: Ending consonants may match the ending consonant in standard German. These matches are represented below. If they do not match, they will likely all be "n".

### Definite Articles

Gender | NOM   | ACC | DAT
-------|-------|-----|-----
M      | da    | in  | im
F      | de/d' | de/d'| da
N      | des/s'| des/s'| im
PL     | de/d' | de/d' | de/d'

### Indefinite Articles

**Positive forms**

Gender | NOM | ACC | DAT | GEN
-------|-----|-----|-----|-----
M      | a   | an  | an  | von an
F      | a   | a   | ana | ana
N      | a   | a   | an  | von an
PL     | ‚àÖ   | ‚àÖ   | ‚àÖ   | ‚àÖ

**Negative forms**

Similar to if one declined "no" in an English sentence such as "I have no money". That is, _i hob ka g√∂d_, or another example <ex>_i hob kan Cent_ / I have not a cent</ex>.

Gender | NOM  | ACC | DAT | GEN
-------|------|-----|-----|-----
M      | ka   | kan | kam | von kan
F      | ka   | ka  | kana| kana
N      | ka   | ka  | kam | von kan
PL     | kane | kane| kane| kana

kein/keine = ka
keinen/keinem = kan
keiner = kana
kaines = von kan

# Adjectives

## Comparatives

m√ºd ‚Äì m√ºda ‚Äì am m√ºdestn
mild ‚Äì milder ‚Äì mildest
schee ‚Äì scheena ‚Äì am scheenstn

# Verbs

There are four tenses in Bavarian German which are formed by the base verb plus "half verbs", such as `sei:to be` to change the tense:

1. present ‚Äì what is occurring now
2. past/perfect ‚Äì an action that occured in the past, prior to the present action
3. past perfect/pluperfect ‚Äì an action that occurs in the past, but prior to a past timeframe already established
4. future ‚Äì an action that will occur at a future time

When learning new verbs it is helpful to learn the 3SG, 3PL, perfect participle. The first two, 3SG and 3PL help you know the singular and plural roots for the present tense. The perfect participle will be used for other tenses.

The general rule is that the conjugated verb goes in the "2nd position" in the sentence. "I hob...", for example. The participle often goes at the end. In relative clauses (nobens√§tze, lit. side clauses), the verb often goes at the end.

## Present Tense

From the stem, add the following suffixes. The 1SG suffix is a `'`, indicating there is no ending. This is often written, hence differentiating from ‚àÖ (or nothing at all).

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|-' |-n
2|-st|-ts
3|-t |-n

Thus, with `kaffa:to buy`, stem _kauf_:

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|kauf' |kaufn
2|kaufst|kaufts
3|kauft |kaufn

## Past/Perfect

This tense describes an action that has occurred in the past, prior to the present action.

Formed with `hom:to have` in the present tense, plus the perfect participle. Ex. <ex>_I hob gmoant_ / I thought</ex><cite>[Bayrisches W√∂rterbuch, Verben](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/bairische-grammatik/)</cite>

## Past Pefect/Pluperfect

This tense describes an action that occurs in the past, but prior to a past timeframe already established.

Formed with `hom:to have` in the present tense, plus the perfect participle, plus the perfect participle of "to have", _ghabt_. Ex. <ex>_I hob gmoant ghabt_ / I had thought</ex><cite>[Bayrisches W√∂rterbuch, Verben](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/bairische-grammatik/)</cite>

## Future

This tense describes an action that will occur in the future.

Formed with `wern: to start` in the present tense and the verb in the infinitive. Ex. <ex>_I wea moana_ / I will think</ex><cite>[Bayrisches W√∂rterbuch, Verben](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/bairische-grammatik/)</cite>

Note that _wern_ has many different spellings due to the _er_ combination:

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|wea/wia/wer|wern/wian
2|werst/wiast|werds/wiats
3|werd/wiat  |wern/wian

## Irregular Verbs

- `geh:to go`, stem _geh_, is regular except for 1PL and 3PL, which are _genga_.

### To Be (sei)

The past tense is regular, with a stem of _woa_.

#### Present Tense

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|bi|san/samma
2|bist|seids
3|is|san

_samma_ is the emphatic form of "we are", commonly heard in the song "Bayern, des samma mia", or "Bavarians, that's what we are".

3SG is often dropped to `'s` both speaking and in writing and is suffixed to the preceding word. For example, `gibt's:there is`.

### To Have (hom)

ùïØ: "o" may be written/pronounced as "au" and 3SG.SG may have a "t" rather than "d".

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|hob|hom
2|host|hobst
3|hod|hom

# Question Words

- wea: who
- wenn: when
- wie: how
- wos: what
- w√∂che: which

Speakers often drop the pronoun when asking a question, but should include it, when asking with emphasis on rejoiner question.

# Modals

There's a lot going on with modal particles, so this section is going to be quite bare for a while, I expect.

- a: also (and...)
- scho: already (and...)

# Prepositions

The noun that follows a preposition will be one of the cases listed below.

Prepositions can have a lot of meanings and equivalencies, which will be updated as they are encountered.

## With DAT

- bei: at (e.g. a party)
- vo: of, from
- vor: before

- noch: after, to a destination
- vo: from
- zu/z': to, for a holiday (`z'Weinochtn:for Christmas`)

# Pronunciation

A lot of Bavarian is presented as regular phonetic transformations of Standard German. And for the most part, especially with uncommon nouns, etc. it seems to be. Between dialects, of course, there is also variation, which I will attempt to distinguish below, as well.

In the descriptions below V is any vowel, while C is any consonant.

- gs is pronounced /ks/ and is sometimes written as "x", as as `xund:health`
- ending Ns may be dropped and nasalize the final vowel such as in `i konn:I am able` => `i k√µ`
- final `-el` is kind of an √∂ or i sound, such as in `eadopfi:potato`, often when "el" is in the middle of a word, it is written as "√∂"
- "r" is pronounced as "a" after vowels and before consonants, but not after consonants

## Umlaut

Umlaut is the changing of a vowel to change the form of a word. To better illustrate the change from one vowel to the other, the change will be done with Standard German as an intermediary, since it makes it very clear what's going on: add Ãà to the vowel and you get a new vowel: a + Ãà = √§.

1. a -> √§ -> √§
2. o -> √∂ -> e
3  u -> √º -> i
4. au -> √§u -> ei
5. e -> eu -> ei


## Dialect Variations

- `VbV` == `VwV`
  - ex. oba/owa
  - speaker preference, may change based on word
- a/oa is often in free variation between speakers, even amongst the same family
  - ex. ans/oans, zwa/zwoa

## Changes from Standard German

- Vl changes from German
  - al = oi
  - el = √∂
  - il = √º
- "a" is often "o"/√•
- "o" is often "u", but may be "i" closer to Salzburg/German border

## When is Standard German still used?

- _ich liebe_ (I love...). _I lieb_ is very rarely used.
- _mit alles_/_mit scharf_ (a jocular, grammatically incorrect way of saying "with everything"/"with spice") when ordering d√∂ner. From Turkish speakers of German as a second language. For example, you would order a d√∂ner with everything as _I h√§tt gean an kebap mit alles_.

# Sentence Structure

As with standard German, there is also the common rule of "the verb is the second word in the sentence".

## Negation

TODO 
- ned: not, kane: none (or any, in a negative sense)
- to not be = to be + KA, _I bi ka Aungsthos_, I am not a coward.

## Possession

There is no GEN in Bavarian German. Rather, there are two structures which are used to express possession.

The first is rather simple, with `vo:of`. The structure is "(possessed) vo(m) (possessor)". _vom_ is used when the possessor is M or N, as contraction of "vo" and "dem". For example, _da Hund vom Kind_ is the kid's dog.

The second is more complicated and is generally considered to be more Austrian. It is of the form "(DAT definite article) possessor (POSS article, declined) possessed". Thus, _im Kind sei Hund_ is also "the kid's dog". Using this example, the two "grammatical" parts of this structure are:

- DAT definite article: _im_ is the DAT.N definite article and is the same gender as the possessor
- POSS article: _sei_ is the POSS.M.NOM article. The POSS article will decline based on location in the sentence and the gender of the possessor. Thus there will be two pairs: for M and N ‚Äì `im ... sei/sein/seim` and for F - `da ... ia/ian/iara`. For PL, it is `im ... seine` and `da ... iare` for all cases.

The gender of the possessed has no bearing on the formation of this structure.

Thus, put all together:

&nbsp; | M  | F | N | PL.M | PL.F
NOM    | im...sei | da...ia | im...sei | im...seine | da...iare
ACC    | im...sein | da...ian | im...sein | im...seine | da...iare
DAT    | im...seim | da...iara | im...seim | im...seine | da...iare

--EX--
im Hons sei Bruada und im Hons sei Schwesta,
the brother of Hans and the sister of Hans // NOM
da Klara ia Schwesta
the sister of Klara // NOM
im Kind sei Sp√ºzeig
the toy of the child // NOM
--ENDEX--

# Numbers

1 - ans / oans
2 - zwa / zwoa
3 - drei
4 - via
5 - f√ºnf / fimf
6 - sechs
7 - siem
8 - ocht
9 - nei
10 - zehn
11 - √∂f
12 - zw√∂f

Teens, 13-19: ones + zehn, ex. `dreizehn:13`.

20 - zwanzg
30 - drei√üg

Tens, ones + _a_ + tens, ex. `dreiazwanzg:23` (drei-a-zwanzg)

There are two exceptions:

- 21, 31, etc. drops the _-s_ in "ans", thus, `anazwanzg:21`.
- numbers ending in _a_ join with _ra_ instead of _a_, thus `viarazwanzg:24`.

## Dictionaries

### Austrian

- [√ñsterreichisch](https://www.ostarrichi.org)

### German

- [Bairisches W√∂rterbuch](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/aussprache-bayrisch/) ‚Äì has a good section on grammar, phonology, etc. in addition to the dictionary part.
