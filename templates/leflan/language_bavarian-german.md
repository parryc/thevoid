# On Dialect

The notes below are in the context of the Austrian dialect. Pronunciation, spelling, word choice, etc. will as such be slightly different than if you are coming from a more Munich/German focus. Additionally, between ages, urban vs. rural, city vs. city, there will be variation, not just in dialect versions, but the use of dialect vs. standard German. Please let me know if your regional variation is missing and I will gladly add it.

Often the first way that I encountered it will be written as the "definitive" version. Variations will be indicated with "ùïØ".

# On Spelling

As an informally or colloquially written language, there are almost as many ways of writing as there are speakers. As many of the spellings for grammatical items I know of are listed as appropriate. These will often be indicated with "ùïØ", unless originally taught to me as a free variation.

# Nouns

## Plural Pronouns

There a number of different ways the plural can be formed:

1. +a: `kind:child` -> `kinda:children`
2. umlaut (changing of the vowel): `haus:house` -> `heisa:houses`
3. 

# Pronouns

## Articles

ùïØ: Ending consonants may match the ending consonant in standard German. These matches are represented below. If they do not match, they will likely all be "n".

### Definite Articles

# Verbs

There are four tenses in Bavarian German which are formed by the base verb plus "half verbs", such as `sei:to be` to change the tense:

1. present ‚Äì what is occurring now
2. past/perfect ‚Äì an action that occured in the past, prior to the present action
3. past perfect/pluperfect ‚Äì an action that occurs in the past, but prior to a past timeframe already established
4. future ‚Äì an action that will occur at a future time

When learning new verbs it is helpful to learn the 3SG, 3PL, perfect participle. The first two, 3SG and 3PL help you know the singular and plural roots for the present tense. The perfect participle will be used for other tenses.

## Present Tense

From the stem, add the following suffixes. The 1SG suffix is a `'`, indicating there is no ending. This is often written, hence differentiating from ‚àÖ (or nothing at all).

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|-' |-n
2|-st|-ts
3|-t |-n

Thus, with `kaffa:to buy`, stem _kauf_:

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|kauf' |kaufn
2|kaufst|kaufts
3|kauft |kaufn

## Past/Perfect

This tense describes an action that has occurred in the past, prior to the present action.

Formed with `hom:to have` in the present tense, plus the perfect participle. Ex. <ex>_I hob gmoant_ / I thought</ex><cite>[Bayrisches W√∂rterbuch, Verben](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/bairische-grammatik/)</cite>

## Past Pefect/Pluperfect

This tense describes an action that occurs in the past, but prior to a past timeframe already established.

Formed with `hom:to have` in the present tense, plus the perfect participle, plus the perfect participle of "to have", _ghabt_. Ex. <ex>_I hob gmoant ghabt_ / I had thought</ex><cite>[Bayrisches W√∂rterbuch, Verben](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/bairische-grammatik/)</cite>

## Future

This tense describes an action that will occur in the future.

Formed with `wern: to start` in the present tense and the verb in the infinitive. Ex. <ex>_I wea moana_ / I will think</ex><cite>[Bayrisches W√∂rterbuch, Verben](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/bairische-grammatik/)</cite>

Note that _wern_ has many different spellings due to the _er_ combination:

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|wea/wia/wer|wern/wian
2|werst/wiast|werds/wiats
3|werd/wiat  |wern/wian

## Irregular Verbs

- `geh:to go`, stem _geh_, is regular except for 1PL and 3PL, which are _genga_.

### To Be (sei)

The past tense is regular, with a stem of _woa_.

#### Present Tense

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|bi|san/samma
2|bist|seids
3|is|san

_samma_ is the emphatic form of "we are", commonly heard in the song "Bayern, des samma mia", or "Bavarians, that's what we are".

3SG is often dropped to `'s` both speaking and in writing and is suffixed to the preceding word. For example, `gibt's:there is`.

### To Have (hom)

ùïØ: "o" may be written/pronounced as "au" and 3SG.SG may have a "t" rather than "d".

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|hob|hom
2|host|hobst
3|hod|hom

# Question Words

- wenn: when
- wie: how
- wos: what
- w√∂che: which

Speakers often drop the pronoun when asking a question, but should include it, when asking with emphasis on rejoiner question.

# Modals

There's a lot going on with modal particles, so this section is going to be quite bare for a while, I expect.

- a: also (and...)
- scho: already (and...)

# Prepositions

- noch: after, to a destination
- vo: from
- zu/z': to, for a holiday (`z'Weinochtn:for Christmas`)

# Pronunciation

A lot of Bavarian is presented as regular phonetic transformations of Standard German. And for the most part, especially with uncommon nouns, etc. it seems to be. Between dialects, of course, there is also variation, which I will attempt to distinguish below, as well.

In the descriptions below V is any vowel, while C is any consonant.

- gs is pronounced /ks/ and is sometimes written as "x", as as `xund:health`
- ending Ns may be dropped and nasalize the final vowel such as in `i konn:I am able` => `i k√µ`
- final `-el` is kind of an √∂ or i sound, such as in `eadopfi:potato`, often when "el" is in the middle of a word, it is written as "√∂"
- "r" is pronounced as "a" after vowels and before consonants, but not after consonants

## Umlaut

Umlaut is the changing of a vowel to change the form of a word. To better illustrate the change from one vowel to the other, the change will be done with Standard German as an intermediary, since it makes it very clear what's going on: add Ãà to the vowel and you get a new vowel: a + Ãà = √§.

1. a -> √§ -> √§
2. o -> √∂ -> e
3  u -> √º -> i
4. au -> √§u -> ei
5. e -> eu -> ei


## Dialect Variations

- `VbV` == `VwV`
  - ex. oba/owa
  - speaker preference, may change based on word
- a/oa is often in free variation between speakers, even amongst the same family
  - ex. ans/oans, zwa/zwoa

## Changes from Standard German

- Vl changes from German
  - al = oi
  - el = √∂
  - il = √º
- "a" is often "o"/√•
- "o" is often "u", but may be "i" closer to Salzburg/German border

## When is Standard German still used?

- _ich liebe_ (I love...). _I lieb_ is very rarely used.
- _mit alles_/_mit scharf_ (a jocular, grammatically incorrect way of saying "with everything"/"with spice") when ordering d√∂ner. From Turkish speakers of German as a second language. For example, you would order a d√∂ner with everything as _I h√§tt gean an kebap mit alles_.

# Sentence Structure

As with standard German, there is also the common rule of "the verb is the second word in the sentence".

## Negation

TODO 
- ned: not, kane: none (or any, in a negative sense)
- to not be = to be + KA, _I bi ka Aungsthos_, I am not a coward.

# Numbers

1 - ans / oans
2 - zwa / zwoa
3 - drei
4 - via
5 - f√ºnf / fimf
6 - sechs
7 - siem
8 - ocht
9 - nei
10 - zehn
11 - √∂f
12 - zw√∂f

Teens, 13-19: ones + zehn, ex. `dreizehn:13`.

20 - zwanzg
30 - drei√üg

Tens, ones + _a_ + tens, ex. `dreiazwanzg:23` (drei-a-zwanzg)

There are two exceptions:

- 21, 31, etc. drops the _-s_ in "ans", thus, `anazwanzg:21`.
- numbers ending in _a_ join with _ra_ instead of _a_, thus `viarazwanzg:24`.

## Dictionaries

### Austrian

- [√ñsterreichisch](https://www.ostarrichi.org)
- [√ñsterreichisches W√∂rterbuch](https://www.%C3%B6wb.at/) ‚Äì iirc, this one may sometimes ask for a code. I entered `1111` and it worked.
- [Trilingual dictionary](http://www.fim.uni-linz.ac.at/Woerterbuch_oesterr_deut_englisch.htm#abc) ‚Äì this is nice because it clearly says if it is a positive, negative, or neutral word.

### German

- [Bairisches W√∂rterbuch](https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/aussprache-bayrisch/) ‚Äì has a good section on grammar, phonology, etc. in addition to the dictionary part.
