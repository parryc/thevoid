# On Dialect

The notes below are in the context of the Austrian dialect. Pronunciation, spelling, word choice, etc. will as such be slightly different than if you are coming from a more Munich/German focus. Additionally, between ages, urban vs. rural, city vs. city, there will be variation, not just in dialect versions, but the use of dialect vs. standard German. Please let me know if your regional variation is missing and I will gladly add it.

Often the first way that I encountered it will be written as the "definitive" version. Variations will be indicated with "𝕯".

# On Spelling

As an informally or colloquially written language, there are almost as many ways of writing as there are speakers. As many of the spellings for grammatical items I know of are listed as appropriate. These will often be indicated with "𝕯", unless originally taught to me as a free variation.

# Nouns

## Gender

There are three genders: masculine, feminine, and neutral. These are represented as M, F, and N in the tables below. Outside of natural gender (e.g. that is a female chicken, that is a male scorpion), it is not always possible to identify the gender of a noun based on spelling.

There are a few rules to help, though:

- those ending in _-ung_ are always female

## Plural Pronouns

There a number of different ways the plural can be formed:

1. +a: `kind:child` -> `kinda:children`
2. umlaut (changing of the vowel): `haus:house` -> `heisa:houses`
3. 

# Pronouns

## Personal Pronouns

Number | NOM    | ACC   | DAT   
-------|--------|-------|-------
1SG    | i      |  mi   | ma    
2SG    | du     |  di   | da

## Posessive Pronouns

TODO: actually needs to be per case, per person
1SG: NOM - mei/mei/?/meine / DAT (mit?) meim/meina/?/?

Number | NOM    | ACC   | DAT   
-------|--------|-------|-------
1SG    |        |       |       
2SG    |        |       |

## Relative Pronouns

"who/which"

NOM | dea | die |des
ACC | dem 
DAT | dem

--EX--
I hob docht, dass mei Kolleg, dea in München wohnt, a echta Bayer is.
I had thought that my colleague, who lives in Munich, is a true Bavarian.
--ENDEX--

## Reflexive Pronouns

Only 1SG and 2SG differ, 3SG and 3PL are the same, _si_, which is found in dictionaries to indicate that a verb is reflexive.

&nbsp; | 1SG | 2SG | 1PL | 2PL | 3SG/3PL
-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------
ACC    | mi  | di  | uns | eich| si
DAT    | ma  | da  | uns | eich| si

## Articles

𝕯: Ending consonants may match the ending consonant in standard German. These matches are represented below. If they do not match, they will likely all be "n".

### Definite Articles

Gender | NOM   | ACC | DAT
-------|-------|-----|-----
M      | da    | in  | im
F      | de/d' | de/d'| da
N      | des/s'| des/s'| im
PL     | de/d' | de/d' | de/d'

### Indefinite Articles

**Positive forms**

Gender | NOM | ACC | DAT | GEN
-------|-----|-----|-----|-----
M      | a   | an  | an  | von an
F      | a   | a   | ana | ana
N      | a   | a   | an  | von an
PL     | ∅   | ∅   | ∅   | ∅

**Negative forms**

Similar to if one declined "no" in an English sentence such as "I have no money". That is, _i hob ka göd_, or another example <ex>_i hob kan Cent_ / I have not a cent</ex>.

Gender | NOM  | ACC | DAT | GEN
-------|------|-----|-----|-----
M      | ka   | kan | kam | von kan
F      | ka   | ka  | kana| kana

# Verbs

## Tenses

There are four tenses in Bavarian German which are formed by the base verb plus "half verbs", such as `sei:to be` to change the tense:

1. present – what is occurring now
2. past/perfect – an action that occured in the past, prior to the present action
3. past perfect/pluperfect – an action that occurs in the past, but prior to a past timeframe already established
4. future – an action that will occur at a future time

When learning new verbs it is helpful to learn the 3SG, 3PL, perfect participle. The first two, 3SG and 3PL help you know the singular and plural roots for the present tense. The perfect participle will be used for other tenses.

The general rule is that the conjugated verb goes in the "2nd position" in the sentence. "I hob...", for example. The participle often goes at the end. In relative clauses (nobensätze, lit. side clauses), the verb often goes at the end.

### Present Tense

From the stem, add the following suffixes. The 1SG suffix is a `'`, indicating there is no ending. This is often written, hence differentiating from ∅ (or nothing at all).

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|-' |-n
2|-st|-ts
3|-t |-n

Thus, with `kaffa:to buy`, stem _kauf_:

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|kauf' |kaufn
2|kaufst|kaufts
3|kauft |kaufn

### Past/Perfect

This tense describes an action that has occurred in the past, prior to the present action.

It is most often formed with `hom:to have` in the present tense, plus the perfect participle. Ex. <ex>_I hob gsogt_ / I said</ex>, where _hob_ is 1SG form of _hom_ and _gsogt_ is the past participle of `sogn:to say`.

Some verbs, however, take `sei:to be` as their auxiliary verb. These verbs are verbs of movement or state, such as to jump, to swim, to stay (movement without movevement), to be. This list does not differ (at least as I've been told) from Standard German. For example, <ex>_I bin ghupft_ / I jumped</ex>.

### Past Pefect/Pluperfect

This tense describes an action that occurs in the past, but prior to a past timeframe already established.

Formed with `hom:to have` in the present tense, plus the perfect participle, plus the perfect participle of "to have", _ghabt_. Ex. <ex>_I hob gmoant ghabt_ / I had thought</ex><cite>[Bayrisches Wörterbuch, Verben](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.bayrisches-woerterbuch.de/bairisch-lernen/bairische-grammatik/__;!!Iz9xO38YGHZK!8sR7OtwbG4y0sevbrjaIDweur-RLgnWTjOgp36_03yTI_aOevgorantI0Qk63GGUGm8XYtMmZXYlZ3RI5WPipA$ )</cite>

### Future (wean)

𝕯: May also be seen as "wern" and "wian" and declined appropriately. 1SG may also drop the final "-d". There's so much variable that all forms encountered are listed below. The forms given by my tutor are listed first.

This tense describes an action that will occur in the future.

Formed with `wean:to become` in the present tense and the verb in the infinitive. Ex. <ex>_I wead im Juli noch Ö foan_ / I will go to Austria in July</ex>.

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|wead/wea/wia/wer|wean/wian/wern
2|wiast/werst     |weats/wiats/werds
3|wiad/wiat/werd  |wean/wian/wern

## Verb Types

There are three main categories of verbs: seperable, inseperable, and reflexive. Separable and inseparable should be thought of as a pair, since a verb is either separable or inseparable. This refers to the whether or not the verb prefix is separable from the verb root. Reflexive verbs act on the subject of the sentence (e.g. she did it to herself) and often are required in places where English verbs do not take a reflexive pronoun.

### Seperable & Inseperable

Separable and inseparable refer to whether or not the verbal prefix is separated from the verbal root. An example of a separable verb is `eischoitn:to turn off`. The `ei` prefix is separated from the verb root, `schoitn`. Thus we get <ex>_I schoit des Liacht ei_ / I'm turning off the light</ex>. With the structural difference established, each type can be summarized with a few characteristics.

**Seperable Verbs**

- Contains _g-_ in the past participle, thus _eigschoit_

--EX--
I moch d'Tia auf
I'm opening the door
--ENDEX--

**Inseparable Verbs**

𝕯: _da_ is often used instead of _va_ or _ea_.

There are a limited set of prefixes that are considered inseparable: b (or be), ent, g, da, va, ea. _da_, in addition to a "generic prefix" meaning, can also have a "till death meaning". For example, `schiaßn:to shoot` vs `daschiaßn:to shoot someone to death`. This can also take on metaphorical meaning, with `lem: to live` vs. `dalem: to live to see the death (of something)`, or more figuratively, "to live to see change in the world". 

- Does not contain a _g-_ in the past participle (unless of course the prefix is _g_ itself)

## Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs require a reflexive pronoun. Although the pronoun is there, they are not always translated with a pronoun in English. For example `si gfrien:to be glad, to look forward to something`, is a reflexive verb, but one not normally say "I am, myself, glad that...". Reflexive verbs should be marked as such in dictionaries with _si_, which is the 3SG/3PL REFL pronoun. These types of verbs take either ACC or DAT REFL pronouns, which differ only in 1SG and 2SG.

--EX--
I gfrei mi echt für di.
I am really happy for your.
--ENDEX--

## Irregular Verbs

- `geh:to go`, stem _geh_, is regular except for 1PL and 3PL, which are _genga_.

### To Be (sei)

The past tense is regular, with a stem of _woa_, one of two verbs that still has a declinable past tense. See below for more info.

#### Present Tense

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|bi|san/samma
2|bist|seids
3|is|san

_samma_ is the emphatic form of "we are", commonly heard in the song "Bayern, des samma mia", or "Bavarians, that's what we are".

3SG is often dropped to `'s` both speaking and in writing and is suffixed to the preceding word. For example, `gibt's:there is`.

### To Have (hom)

𝕯: "o" may be written/pronounced as "au" and 3SG.SG may have a "t" rather than "d".

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|hob|hom/homma
2|host|hobst
3|hod|hom

Like _samma_ above, _homma_ is the emphatic form of "to have" for 1PL.

### The Simple Past

There are only two verbs which are still used in the simple past, that is, as a declined form without the use of a past participle. These are `woin:to want` and `sei:to be` (see above).

#### To Want (woin)

You may sometimes, but less frequently, see _woin_ as a past participle.

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|woit|woitn
2|woitst|woitats
3|woit|woitn

--EX--
I woit ans kaufm.
I wanted to buy one.
I hob ans kaufm woin.
I wanted to buy one. // This form is less common.
--ENDEX--

## Passive Voice

Passive voice is formed with different pairings of auxiliary verbs (either `wean:to become` or `sei:to be`), a verb declined in PRS, and optionally a third word, either the infinitive or the past participle. The passive voice is when the object of a verb acts as the subject – the subject is not necessarily explicit in the sentence and may be left ambiguous (if unknown).

In the examples below, the verb is `kaffa:to buy`, or _kauft_ in 3SG.

**Present**

Auxiliary verb: _wean_
No third word.

<ex>_Des letzte Buach wiad kauft_ / The last book is being boughten (by someone)</ex>.

**Future**

Auxiliary verb: _wean_
Infinitive: _wean_

<ex>_Des letzte Buach wiad kauft wean_ / The last book will be boughten (by someone)</ex>.

**Past**

Auxiliary verb: _sei_
Past participle: _woan_

<ex>_Des letzte Buach is kauft woan_ / The last book has been boughten (by someone)</ex>.

# Question Words

- wea: who
- wenn: when
- wie: how
- wos: what
- wöche: which

Speakers often drop the pronoun when asking a question, but should include it, when asking with emphasis on rejoiner question.

# Modals

There's a lot going on with modal particles, so this section is going to be quite bare for a while, I expect.

- a: also (and...)
- scho: already (and...)

# Prepositions

The noun that follows a preposition will be one of the cases listed below. Most prepositions can take either ACC or DAT. The difference lies mostly in stative versus active senses. In DAT, it desscribes where you are and what you're doing ("I'm _at_ the restaurant") versus in ACC, it describes where you're going ("I'm going _to_ the restaurant").

Each preposition is combined with an implied article for the noun that follows the preposition. Generally speaking, in DAT, the combined form is the preposition plus _-m_ for M and N and _-a_ for F (occasionally the standalone article _da_). In ACC, it would be _-n_, _-d_, _-s_, respectively for the genders. When deviations are known, they are listed below.

Prepositions can have a lot of meanings and equivalencies, which will be updated as they are encountered. 

## With ACC

- an: towards close to a location
- hinta: to behind someplace
- in (M. _indn_): to (a place, regularly)
- üba/üwa/iwa: about, over (motion), for a period of time
- unta: under (motion)
- voa/vua: in front of (motion)
- zwischn: between (motion)

## With DAT

- an: near a location, close to
- aus: out of, leaving from a place
- bei: at (e.g. a party), chez
- hinta: behind
- in: in a place
- noch: after, to a destination
- üba/üwa/iwa: over (static)
- unta: under (static)
- vo: of, from
- voa/vua: in front of (static), before (static)
- zu/z': to (a person or thing, often once), for a holiday (`z'Weinochtn:for Christmas`)
- zwischn: between (static)

"zua" and "in" can be tricky in English since they are both "to". One way of distinguishing, especially if the location is ambiguously a person or a place, such as "therapy", is that "zua" is used when one goes to the location once, whereas "in" is used when one goes regularly. Compare <ex>_I geh zua Therapie_ / I'm going to therapy (once, e.g. to try it out)</ex> vs. <ex>_I geh in Therapie_ / I go to therapy (every Tuesday)</ex>.

--EX--
I foa ind Stodt.
I'm driving to the city.
I foa in da Stodt.
I'm driving in the city.
--ENDED--

# Pronunciation

A lot of Bavarian is presented as regular phonetic transformations of Standard German. And for the most part, especially with uncommon nouns, etc. it seems to be. Between dialects, of course, there is also variation, which I will attempt to distinguish below, as well.

In the descriptions below V is any vowel, while C is any consonant.

- gs is pronounced /ks/ and is sometimes written as "x", as as `xund:health`
- ending Ns may be dropped and nasalize the final vowel such as in `i konn:I am able` => `i kõ`
- final `-el` is kind of an ö or i sound, such as in `eadopfi:potato`, often when "el" is in the middle of a word, it is written as "ö"
- "r" is pronounced as "a" after vowels and before consonants, but not after consonants

## Umlaut

Umlaut is the changing of a vowel to change the form of a word. To better illustrate the change from one vowel to the other, the change will be done with Standard German as an intermediary, since it makes it very clear what's going on: add ̈ to the vowel and you get a new vowel: a + ̈ = ä.

1. a -> ä -> ä
2. o -> ö -> e
3  u -> ü -> i
4. au -> äu -> ei
5. e -> eu -> ei

## Dialect Variations

- `VbV` == `VwV`
  - ex. oba/owa
  - speaker preference, may change based on word
- a/oa is often in free variation between speakers, even amongst the same family
  - ex. ans/oans, zwa/zwoa

## Changes from Standard German

- Vl changes from German
  - al = oi
  - el = ö
  - il = ü
- "a" is often "o"/å
- "o" is often "u", but may be "i" closer to Salzburg/German border

## When is Standard German still used?

- _ich liebe_ (I love...). _I lieb_ is very rarely used.
- _mit alles_/_mit scharf_ (a jocular, grammatically incorrect way of saying "with everything"/"with spice") when ordering döner. From Turkish speakers of German as a second language. For example, you would order a döner with everything as _I hätt gean an kebap mit alles_.

# Sentence Structure

As with standard German, there is also the common rule of "the verb is the second word in the sentence".

- sentence final "eh" is very common in Austria, mostly equivalent to "anyways" in English.

## Negation

TODO 
- ned: not, kane: none (or any, in a negative sense)
- to not be = to be + KA, _I bi ka Aungsthos_, I am not a coward.

## Possession

There is no GEN in Bavarian German. Rather, there are two structures which are used to express possession.

The first is rather simple, with `vo:of`. The structure is "(possessed) vo(m) (possessor)". _vom_ is used when the possessor is M or N, as contraction of "vo" and "dem". For example, _da Hund vom Kind_ is the kid's dog.

The second is more complicated and is generally considered to be more Austrian. It is of the form "(DAT definite article) possessor (POSS article, declined) possessed". Thus, _im Kind sei Hund_ is also "the kid's dog". Using this example, the two "grammatical" parts of this structure are:

- DAT definite article: _im_ is the DAT.N definite article and is the same gender as the possessor
- POSS article: _sei_ is the POSS.M.NOM article. The POSS article will decline based on location in the sentence and the gender of the possessor. Thus there will be two pairs: for M and N – `im ... sei/sein/seim` and for F - `da ... ia/ian/iara`. For PL, it is `im ... seine` and `da ... iare` for all cases.

The gender of the possessed has no bearing on the formation of this structure.

Thus, put all together:

&nbsp; | M  | F | N | PL.M | PL.F
-------|----|---|---|------|------
NOM    | im...sei | da...ia | im...sei | im...seine | da...iare
ACC    | im...sein | da...ian | im...sein | im...seine | da...iare
DAT    | im...seim | da...iara | im...seim | im...seine | da...iare

--EX--
im Hons sei Bruada und im Hons sei Schwesta,
the brother of Hans and the sister of Hans // NOM
da Klara ia Schwesta
the sister of Klara // NOM
im Kind sei Spüzeig
the toy of the child // NOM
--ENDEX--

## Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are clauses in sentences that bein with `wenn:when`, `wie:when`, or `weil:because`. They are always offset with a comma and may occur at the beginning of the sentence. Structurally, the main difference between a normal clause is that the verb in a relative clause appears at the end of the clause. The clause that is paired with the relative clause has the verb at the beginning.

 For example, <ex>_Wenn i wos essn geh, dring i imma a Bier_ / When I go out to eat (something), I always drink a beer</ex>. Note the location of `geh:to go`, at the end of the _wenn_ clause, compared with `dringa:I drink`, and the beginning of the paired clause.

--EX--
Wenn i Urlaub hob, schoit i imma mei Handy aus.
When I'm on vacation, I always turn off my cell phone.
Wenn i hamkumm, schau i ma an Füm o.
When I come home, I watch a movie.
--ENDEX--

## Conditional Sentences (fois/wenn/ob)

There are three different words that indicate conditional sentences: _fois_, _wenn_, and _ob_. The rules for use are straightforward: if "whether" would be used in English (e.g. whether or not), then use _ob_. Otherwise, use _fois_ or _wenn_.

All three forms decline to a certain extent to match the subject of the clause as follows. For 3SG, the slashes indicate M, F, and N forms.

**fois**

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|fois i|fois ma
2|foist|fois'
3|fois a/fois'/fois|fois'

<ex>_Foist des ned mochst, ..._ / If you don't do it, ...</ex>

**wenn**

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|wenn i|wenn ma/wemma
2|wennst|wennts
3|wenn a/wenn's/wenn's|wenn's


<ex>_Wennst des ned mochst, ..._ / If you don't do it, ...</ex>

**ob**

&nbsp; |SG  |PL
-|----------|--
1|ob i|ob ma
2|obst|obts
3|ob a/ob's/ob's|ob's

<ex>_I waß no ned, ob i hamgeh werd._ / I don't know whether or not I will go home.</ex>

## Have to do something (sei + zum)

To express the sense of having to do something, one uses "to be" + zum + the verb you have to do in the infinitive.

Thus, <ex>_Des is zum mocha_ / I have to do it</ex>.

# Numbers

1 - ans / oans
2 - zwa / zwoa
3 - drei
4 - via
5 - fünf / fimf
6 - sechs
7 - siem
8 - ocht
9 - nei
10 - zehn
11 - öf
12 - zwöf

Teens, 13-19: ones + zehn, ex. `dreizehn:13`.

20 - zwanzg
30 - dreißg

Tens, ones + _a_ + tens, ex. `dreiazwanzg:23` (drei-a-zwanzg)

There are two exceptions:

- 21, 31, etc. drops the _-s_ in "ans", thus, `anazwanzg:21`.
- numbers ending in _a_ join with _ra_ instead of _a_, thus `viarazwanzg:24`.
