## Information on Marbling at Homewood Studios

Happy New Year Midwest Marblers!

As many of you already know, we have found space to marble this year at Homewood Studios in Minneapolis. We are pleased to announce that our first weekend is rapidly approaching – January 14th and January 15th. I hope you're excited as I am – a new year means new possibilities and what better place to explore those new possibilities than with some like-minded individuals and a tray filled with carrageenan!

Marbling at Homewood Studios will be the second weekend of each month. If you would like to sign up now, slots for January and February are open:

- January: [click here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0948AEAF29A5F9C25-homewood)
- February: [click here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0948AEAF29A5F9C25-homewood1)

Some pertinent information on signing up below (more information can be found on the signup page):

- Marbling slots are on a first-come first-served basis.
- There are 6 slots per day – 6 on Saturday, 6 on Sunday, for a total of 12 slots.
- Each slot is $30, which includes 1 gallon of carrageenan – enough to fill a 16x20 tray.
- If you require additional size, please indicate as such in the signup
form. An extra gallon is $5.
- If you have the time and desire, you can sign up to make the carrageenan for the weekend on the Friday before and receive a $15 discount.
- Payment is expected prior to the weekend and signups close the Thursday before, to allow the carrageenan maker enough time to make it.
- Studio times are not fixed, but currently they are approximately
9am-5pm. Participants are expected to clean up, so please factor that in to your scheduling.

Participants are expected to bring:

- Paper
- Paint (including holders, brushes, etc.)
- Eye droppers
- Combs/Rakes

While extra trays are available, access to a specific tray cannot be guaranteed. As such, you are encouraged to bring your own. Space is available if you would like to leave a tray at Homewood Studios for future use.

We want to keep this as flexible and as inviting as possible, so if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,
Scheduling @ Midwest Marbling
